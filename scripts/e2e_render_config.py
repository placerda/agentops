"""Render scenario-specific agentops.yaml files for the e2e workflow.

Reads target identifiers from environment variables (set by the GitHub
Actions workflow from repo Actions Variables + Bicep outputs) and writes
one agentops.yaml per scenario into ``./e2e-runs/<scenario>/``.

Scenarios:
  - foundry-prompt: AGENTOPS_E2E_FOUNDRY_PROMPT_AGENT (e.g. ``e2e-prompt:1``)
  - foundry-hosted: AGENTOPS_E2E_FOUNDRY_HOSTED_URL  (https URL)
  - http-aca:      AGENTOPS_E2E_ACA_URL              (https URL of echo app)
  - model-direct:  AGENTOPS_E2E_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT     (deployment name)

A scenario is skipped (no file written) when its env var is unset, which
lets the workflow run partial scenarios via ``workflow_dispatch.inputs``.

**Target:** Foundry hosted agent `{hosted_agent}` — created dynamically by
this workflow run via `scripts/e2e_hosted_agent.py create` and deleted in
`teardown-live`.

**What it does:** A weather assistant backed by `gpt-4o-mini` with a single
function tool `get_weather(location)`. The agent's instructions tell it to
*always* invoke `get_weather` when the user asks about the weather, instead
of fabricating an answer.

**Tool registered on the agent:**

```json
{{
  "type": "function",
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Get the current weather for a given location.",
  "parameters": {{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {{ "location": {{ "type": "string" }} }},
    "required": ["location"]
  }}
}}
```

**Dataset:** `{rel_tools}` (3 weather questions, each with the expected
`get_weather` tool call as ground truth).

**Evaluators (auto-inferred from `tool_definitions` + `tool_calls`):**
`tool_call_accuracy`, `intent_resolution`, `task_adherence`, plus
`f1_score` and `avg_latency_seconds`. Thresholds are very permissive —
this is a pipeline smoke test, not a quality gate.

> **Note on `intent_resolution` / `task_adherence` low scores:** these are
> AI-judge evaluators that grade the *natural-language* portion of the
> response. This eval is single-turn — the agent stops at the
> `function_call` and we never execute the tool, so the model never gets
> to produce a final natural-language answer. The judges therefore see
> only the synthetic `[Called get_weather(...)]` summary and score it
> low. `tool_call_accuracy` (which judges the structured tool call
> itself) is the meaningful metric for this scenario.

**Target:** A *real* Microsoft Agent Framework chat agent
(`agent_framework.Agent` + `OpenAIChatCompletionClient` against Azure
OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`) deployed as an Azure Container App per workflow
run by `infra/e2e/perrun.bicep` at `{aca_url}`.

**What it does:** The agent (see `infra/e2e/agent-app/app.py`) is a small
FastAPI service that exposes `POST /` accepting `{{"message": "..."}}`
and returning `{{"text": "..."}}`. It runs the user's question through a
single-turn `Agent.run()` call with the instructions:

> *You are a concise factual assistant. Answer the user's question in one
> short sentence. Do not add caveats, disclaimers, or follow-up questions.*

The container authenticates to Azure OpenAI via a User-Assigned Managed
Identity (no API keys) granted `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` on the
shared AI Services account.

**Why this scenario exists:** It exercises AgentOps' `http-json`
invocation path — POSTing a JSON body, parsing a JSON response with a
configurable dot-path, and measuring round-trip latency — against a
freshly-deployed Azure resource the workflow itself owns end to end
(image built server-side via `az acr build`, deployed via Bicep, pulled
with managed identity, torn down by the teardown job).

**Dataset:** `{rel_basic}` (3 short factual rows: arithmetic, capital
city, sky color).

**Evaluators (auto-inferred from dataset shape):** `coherence`, `fluency`,
`similarity`, `f1_score`, plus `avg_latency_seconds`. Thresholds are
intentionally permissive (`>=0`) because the goal is to validate
connectivity and the eval pipeline, not to gate on `gpt-4o-mini` quality.
