"""Render scenario-specific agentops.yaml files for the e2e workflow.

Reads target identifiers from environment variables (set by the GitHub
Actions workflow from repo Actions Variables + Bicep outputs) and writes
one agentops.yaml per scenario into ``./e2e-runs/<scenario>/``.

Scenarios:
  - foundry-prompt: AGENTOPS_E2E_FOUNDRY_PROMPT_AGENT (e.g. ``e2e-prompt:1``)
  - foundry-hosted: AGENTOPS_E2E_FOUNDRY_HOSTED_URL  (https URL)
  - http-aca:      AGENTOPS_E2E_ACA_URL              (https URL of echo app)
  - model-direct:  AGENTOPS_E2E_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT     (deployment name)

A scenario is skipped (no file written) when its env var is unset, which
lets the workflow run partial scenarios via ``workflow_dispatch.inputs``.

**What it does:** A weather assistant backed by `{model}` with a single
function tool `get_weather(location)`. The agent's instructions tell it to
*always* invoke `get_weather` when the user asks about the weather, instead
of fabricating an answer.

**Tool registered on the agent:**

```json

  "parameters": {{

  }}

`get_weather` tool call as ground truth).

`tool_call_accuracy`, `intent_resolution`, `task_adherence`, plus

> to produce a final natural-language answer. The judges therefore see
> only the synthetic `[Called get_weather(...)]` summary and score it

**Target:** A *real* Microsoft Agent Framework chat agent
(`agent_framework.Agent` + `OpenAIChatCompletionClient` against Azure
OpenAI `{model}`) deployed as an Azure Container App per workflow run by
`infra/e2e/perrun.bicep` at `{aca_url}`.

**What it does:** The agent (see `infra/e2e/agent-app/app.py`) is a small
FastAPI service that exposes `POST /` accepting `{{"message": "..."}}`
and returning `{{"text": "...", "tool_calls": [...]}}`. The agent is
configured with one function tool, `get_weather(location)`, and these
instructions:

> *You are a concise factual assistant. When the user asks about the
> weather in a location, you MUST call the `get_weather` tool with that
> location instead of guessing. After the tool returns, summarize the
> weather for the user in one short sentence...*

Each POST is a single AgentOps invocation, but **inside** the agent
there are multiple internal turns: the model picks the tool, the
framework executes it locally, the model observes the canned tool
result, and produces a final natural-language answer. AgentOps captures
the structured tool calls (via `tool_calls_field: tool_calls`) for
`tool_call_accuracy` while the quality evaluators grade the final text.

The container authenticates to Azure OpenAI via a User-Assigned Managed
Identity (no API keys) granted `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` on the
shared AI Services account.

**Why this scenario exists:** It exercises AgentOps' `http-json`
invocation path *plus* tool-call evaluation against a freshly-deployed
Azure resource the workflow itself owns end to end (image built
server-side via `az acr build`, deployed via Bicep, pulled with managed
identity, torn down by the teardown job).

**Dataset:** `{rel_tools}` (3 weather questions across Paris, Tokyo,
São Paulo, each with the expected `get_weather` tool call).

**Evaluators (auto-inferred from dataset shape):** `tool_call_accuracy`,
`coherence`, `fluency`, `f1_score`, plus `avg_latency_seconds`.
Thresholds are intentionally permissive (`>=0`) because the goal is to
validate connectivity and the eval pipeline, not to gate on `{model}`
quality.
