"""Operational excellence check.

Pipeline-hygiene findings that are time-based or stability-based rather
than file-based (which live in :mod:`agentops.agent.checks.mlops`).

Findings emitted:

* ``opex.stale_evaluation`` - Doctor warns when no fresh eval run has
  landed in the configured window.
* ``opex.flaky_metric`` - a metric's coefficient of variation across
  recent runs is high enough to suggest a flaky judge / non-deterministic
  prompt rather than real change.
