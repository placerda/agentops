"""WAF-AI Security: account must have a managed identity assigned.

Cognitive Services / Azure OpenAI accounts call downstream Azure
resources (Storage for fine-tuning data, Key Vault for customer keys,
etc.). The WAF-AI Security pillar recommends using a managed identity
for those calls instead of connection strings or keys.

This rule fires when the account ``identity.type`` is missing or
``None`` — i.e. neither system-assigned nor user-assigned managed
identity is configured.
