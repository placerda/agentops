"""Rule registry for the WAF-AI posture check.

Each rule is a small callable that receives the
:class:`AzureResourcesPayload` and the source name, and returns a list
of :class:`Finding`s (zero, one, or many). Rules are independent and
pure.

The ``posture`` check (see :mod:`agentops.agent.checks.posture`)
iterates the rules registered here and aggregates the findings.

To add a new rule:

* Add a module under this package.
* Implement ``def evaluate(payload, source_name) -> list[Finding]``.
* Register it in :data:`RULE_REGISTRY` below.
