"""Lightweight ``.env`` loader for the AgentOps workspace.

AgentOps reads configuration from the same place ``azd`` writes it:
``.azure/<active-env>/.env``. The CLI auto-loads that file at startup so
contributors do not have to ``export`` env vars in every shell session.

Lookup order (first file that contributes at least one new variable wins):

1. ``.azure/<active-env>/.env`` — the canonical azd-managed env file.
2. ``.agentops/.env`` — legacy compat for workspaces that were configured
   before the azd-first refactor.
3. ``./.env`` — project-root fallback for hand-managed setups.

Design choices:

* **No new dependency.** We parse the file ourselves — only
  ``KEY=VALUE`` lines, blank lines, and ``#`` comments. No shell escapes
  or variable interpolation. This keeps the loader tiny and predictable.
* **Never override.** Variables already present in ``os.environ`` win.
  The ``.env`` files are a fallback, not an override — that matches how
  azd, dotenv, and direnv all behave.
* **Silent on failure.** Missing or malformed files do not crash
  AgentOps; startup must remain fast and robust.
