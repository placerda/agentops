"""Discover Foundry-attached resources from a project endpoint.

Currently exposes one helper: :func:`resolve_appinsights_connection`,
which asks a Foundry project for the connection string of the
Application Insights resource attached to it. Used by
:func:`agentops.utils.telemetry.init_tracing` as a fallback when the
user has configured ``AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`` but not the
explicit ``APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`` env var.

All Azure SDK imports are lazy; the discovery is best-effort and never
raises into callers - a missing SDK, a 404, or any unexpected response
shape returns ``None`` and the caller falls back to its no-op path.
