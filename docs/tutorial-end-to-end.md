# Tutorial — End-to-end with AgentOps

This is the long-form, do-it-yourself tour of AgentOps. By the end you
will have a real Foundry hosted agent with **three function tools**
under evaluation, a baseline-vs-degraded comparison that demonstrates
tool-call regression detection, four GitFlow CI/CD workflows wired to
your own GitHub repo, and a watchdog report summarising your run
history.

It takes around 60–90 minutes the first time. Every step is concrete:
you copy a command, you see an artefact, you keep moving.

> **Why a tool-calling agent?** Production agents fail in interesting
> ways: they pick the wrong tool, fabricate arguments, or skip tool
> use entirely and answer from memory. AgentOps grades all of those
> behaviours — `tool_call_accuracy`, `intent_resolution`,
> `task_adherence` — alongside text quality. A trivia chatbot would
> only exercise the latter; this tutorial uses an agent where tool
> behaviour is the point.

## What you will build

- A Foundry hosted **support agent** with three function tools:
  `lookup_order`, `refund_order`, `escalate_to_human`.
- A flat `agentops.yaml` pointing at that agent with thresholds on
  both text-quality and tool-call metrics.
- A 5-row evaluation dataset of realistic support tickets, each
  carrying `tool_definitions` and the expected `tool_calls`.
- Two evaluation runs (a tool-using **v1** baseline and a degraded
  **v2** that answers from memory) compared side-by-side. The
  baseline-vs-degraded delta shows tool-call accuracy collapse —
  exactly the kind of regression CI is meant to catch.
- Four GitFlow workflows (`pr`, `dev`, `qa`, `prod`) wired to your
  own GitHub repository, gated on threshold pass/fail.
- A watchdog report combining your run history with optional
  Application Insights telemetry.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later.
- Azure CLI (`az --version`) and `az login` working.
- An Azure AI Foundry project (`AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`).
- A model deployment in that project (`gpt-4o-mini` is enough).
- The **Azure AI User** RBAC role on the Foundry account
  (data-plane access required to create agents and call them).
- A GitHub account and the `gh` CLI (or use the web UI for pushes).
- An existing or new GitHub repo — empty is fine; we will populate it.

Set the project endpoint up front so every command picks it up:

```bash
export AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://<your-project>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-name>"
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://<your-aoai-resource>.openai.azure.com"
export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="gpt-4o-mini"
```

## 1. Install AgentOps

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install agentops-toolkit
python -m pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity   # used by the helper script
agentops --version
```

## 2. Create the Foundry hosted support agent

The tutorial uses **three function tools** that a real support agent
would expose:

| Tool | Purpose | Required arguments |
|---|---|---|
| `lookup_order` | Look up an order's status. | `order_id` |
| `refund_order` | Refund an order. | `order_id`, `reason` |
| `escalate_to_human` | Hand the conversation to a human agent. | `category` |

Registering three tools through the portal is fiddly, so this
repository ships a small helper script,
[`scripts/create_support_agent.py`](../scripts/create_support_agent.py),
that does it in one command. Save the file locally (it has no
AgentOps dependency — only `azure-ai-projects` and `azure-identity`)
and run:

```bash
python scripts/create_support_agent.py create --name support-bot
# stdout: support-bot:1
```

The first line of stdout is the `name:version` identifier you paste
into `agentops.yaml` next. The script:

- Creates a hosted prompt agent named `support-bot`.
- Registers the three function tools above with strict JSON Schema
  parameters.
- Pins the system prompt to require tool use whenever the user asks
  about an order, a refund, or talking to a human.
- Prints `support-bot:<version>` on stdout and a friendly summary on
  stderr.

> **Prefer the portal?** Open
> [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) → your project → **Build →
> Agents → New agent**, register the three function tools manually
> (the script's source is the canonical schema), paste the system
> prompt from `INSTRUCTIONS_GOOD` in the script, save, and copy the
> resulting `name:version` string.

## 3. Initialize the workspace

In an empty folder (or the GitHub repo you want to use):

```bash
agentops init
```

You get:

```
.agentops/
├── agentops.yaml
├── data/
│   └── smoke.jsonl
├── datasets/
│   └── smoke.yaml
└── results/
.github/
└── skills/
    └── agentops-*/SKILL.md
```

Open `.agentops/agentops.yaml` and configure it for the support
agent:

```yaml
version: 1
agent: "support-bot:1"

dataset: ./data/tickets.jsonl

thresholds:
  # Tool-calling metrics (auto-inferred from tool_definitions /
  # tool_calls in the dataset).
  tool_call_accuracy: ">=0.8"
  intent_resolution: ">=4"
  task_adherence: ">=0.8"
  # Text quality metrics.
  coherence: ">=3"
  fluency: ">=3"
  similarity: ">=3"
  # Latency budget.
  avg_latency_seconds: "<=10"
```

The `agent: "name:version"` shape is recognised as a **Foundry hosted
agent**. AgentOps invokes it through the Foundry project endpoint
using your `az login` credentials.

## 4. Author the support-ticket dataset

Replace `.agentops/data/smoke.jsonl` with a new
`.agentops/data/tickets.jsonl` carrying five realistic support
tickets. Each row includes:

- `input` — the customer message,
- `expected` — the expected outcome in plain prose,
- `tool_definitions` — every tool the agent has access to,
- `tool_calls` — the tool the agent **should** call (or an empty
  list when the right behaviour is to answer with no tool).

The variety of intents — order lookup, refund, escalation, an
ambiguous query that should resolve to a lookup, and a casual
greeting that should *not* trigger any tool — is what gives the
evaluators something interesting to grade.

```jsonl
{"input": "Where is my order ORD-12345?", "expected": "Calls lookup_order with order_id='ORD-12345'.", "tool_definitions": [{"type": "function", "name": "lookup_order", "description": "Look up an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "refund_order", "description": "Refund an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id", "reason"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "escalate_to_human", "description": "Hand the conversation to a human.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"category": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["category"]}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call_id": "c1", "name": "lookup_order", "arguments": {"order_id": "ORD-12345"}}]}

{"input": "Please connect me to a human about my refund — this has dragged on too long.", "expected": "Calls escalate_to_human with category='refund'.", "tool_definitions": [{"type": "function", "name": "lookup_order", "description": "Look up an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "refund_order", "description": "Refund an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id", "reason"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "escalate_to_human", "description": "Hand the conversation to a human.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"category": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["category"]}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call_id": "c3", "name": "escalate_to_human", "arguments": {"category": "refund"}}]}
{"input": "Did ORD-99001 ship yet?", "expected": "Calls lookup_order with order_id='ORD-99001'.", "tool_definitions": [{"type": "function", "name": "lookup_order", "description": "Look up an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "refund_order", "description": "Refund an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id", "reason"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "escalate_to_human", "description": "Hand the conversation to a human.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"category": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["category"]}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call_id": "c4", "name": "lookup_order", "arguments": {"order_id": "ORD-99001"}}]}
{"input": "Hi there!", "expected": "Replies with a brief greeting and does NOT call any tool.", "tool_definitions": [{"type": "function", "name": "lookup_order", "description": "Look up an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "refund_order", "description": "Refund an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id", "reason"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "escalate_to_human", "description": "Hand the conversation to a human.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"category": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["category"]}}], "tool_calls": []}
```

> **Why each row repeats the full `tool_definitions`?** Each dataset
> row is evaluated independently and the evaluators that check tool
> selection / argument accuracy need the **complete** tool catalogue
> per row. Repetition is the cost of row-level isolation; in real
> projects a small Python script can stamp the same definitions into
> every row at dataset-build time.

The presence of `tool_definitions` and `tool_calls` is what auto-
selects the tool-calling evaluators on top of the standard text-
quality stack. When AgentOps loads the dataset it picks:

| Evaluator | What it grades |
|---|---|
| `ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator` | Did the agent emit the expected tool calls (name + arguments)? |
| `IntentResolutionEvaluator` | Did the agent resolve the user's intent? |
| `TaskAdherenceEvaluator` | Did the agent stick to the system prompt's tool-use rules? |
| `CoherenceEvaluator` / `FluencyEvaluator` / `SimilarityEvaluator` / `F1ScoreEvaluator` | Standard text quality. |
| `avg_latency_seconds` | End-to-end latency budget. |

## 5. Run your first evaluation

```bash
agentops eval run
```

The CLI:

1. Resolves the target from `agentops.yaml`.
2. Calls the Foundry hosted agent once per row, capturing both the
   final text response and the structured tool calls.
3. Runs evaluators using `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`.
4. Writes a timestamped run under `.agentops/results/<id>/` and
   updates `.agentops/results/latest/`.

Inspect the outputs:

```bash
cat .agentops/results/latest/report.md
```

The report has four sections you will revisit often:

- **Verdict** — one line: pass or fail.
- **Per-row transcript** — input, expected, agent response, the
  `tool_calls` the agent emitted, and every metric. The greeting
  row's transcript shows an empty `tool_calls` block — useful when
  debugging false-positive tool calls.
- **Aggregate metrics** — averages across rows.
- **Thresholds** — every rule from `agentops.yaml` with measured
  value. With v1 you should see all the tool-calling thresholds in
  the green.

The exit code is `0` (all thresholds passed) or `2` (one or more
failed). `1` means a runtime error.

## 6. Compare against a degraded baseline

This is where the tutorial earns its keep. Snapshot the run id you
just produced and tell `agentops eval run` to use it as a baseline:

```bash
ls -1 .agentops/results
# 2026-04-29T15-30-12Z   latest
export BASELINE=.agentops/results/2026-04-29T15-30-12Z/results.json
```

Now create a **degraded** version of the agent — same model, same
tools, but a friendly chatbot prompt that drops the tool-use rule:

```bash
python scripts/create_support_agent.py create \
  --name support-bot \
  --variant v2-degraded
# stdout: support-bot:2
```

Update `agentops.yaml`:

```yaml
agent: "support-bot:2"
```

Re-run with the v1 result as the baseline:

```bash
agentops eval run --baseline "$BASELINE"
```

The new `report.md` adds a **Comparison vs Baseline** section with
per-metric deltas. With the degraded prompt you should see something
like:

| Metric | Baseline (v1) | Current (v2) | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tool_call_accuracy` | 0.95 | 0.05 | ▼ −0.90 |
| `intent_resolution` | 4.6 | 2.1 | ▼ −2.5 |
| `task_adherence` | 1.0 | 0.0 | ▼ −1.0 |
| `coherence` | 4.4 | 4.5 | ≈ |
| `fluency` | 4.7 | 4.7 | ≈ |
| `similarity` | 3.6 | 3.4 | ≈ |

Text quality barely moves — the degraded agent is still articulate
and on-topic — but tool-calling collapses, the verdict flips to fail,
and the run exits `2`. **This is the regression-detection loop you
will wire into CI next.**

> Realistic numbers will jitter a bit run-to-run because the
> evaluators themselves are model-graded. The shape of the delta
> (tool metrics down, text metrics flat) is what matters.

## 7. Generate the GitFlow workflows

```bash
agentops workflow generate
```

Four files appear under `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `agentops-pr.yml` | Pull request opened against `develop` or `main` | Runs `agentops eval run` against the baseline; comments the report on the PR; gates merge on threshold pass/fail. |
| `agentops-deploy-dev.yml` | Push to `develop` | Deploys to the **dev** environment after a passing eval. |
| `agentops-deploy-qa.yml` | Push to a `release/*` branch | Deploys to **qa**. |
| `agentops-deploy-prod.yml` | Push to `main` | Deploys to **prod** after a passing eval. |

Read [`ci-github-actions.md`](ci-github-actions.md) for the full
reference. The defaults are sane: you do not need to edit them yet.

## 8. Push to GitHub and watch it run

Initialize the repo and push:

```bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "feat: bootstrap AgentOps eval and CI/CD"
gh repo create my-agent-evals --public --source=. --push
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop
```

### Wire the GitHub Environments

Create three environments in **Settings → Environments**:

- `dev`
- `qa`
- `prod`

For each one, add the secrets and variables the workflows expect:

| Name | Where | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Variable | Your Azure AD tenant id |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Variable | Subscription holding the Foundry project |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Variable | App registration client id (federated) |
| `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | Variable | Same value you exported earlier |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | Variable | Same value you exported earlier |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` | Variable | `gpt-4o-mini` (or your deployment) |

### Configure OIDC (federated credential)

On the app registration backing `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, add federated
credentials for each environment. The subject pattern is:

```
repo:<owner>/<repo>:environment:<env-name>
```

Add one for `environment:dev`, one for `environment:qa`, one for
`environment:prod`, and one for `pull_request` (used by
`agentops-pr.yml`). Grant the app's managed identity at least
`Cognitive Services OpenAI User` on the AOAI resource and the
**Azure AI User** role on the Foundry project (data-plane reads
plus the `agents/*` action surface).

### Open a PR

```bash
git checkout -b feature/tweak-prompt
# make any small change, e.g. edit tickets.jsonl
git commit -am "test: refine ticket dataset"
git push -u origin feature/tweak-prompt
gh pr create --base develop --fill
```

The `agentops-pr.yml` workflow runs. When it finishes you will see:

- A green or red check on the PR.
- A bot comment with the verdict, threshold table (including the
  tool-call metrics), and a link to the full `report.md` artifact.

Merge the PR. `agentops-deploy-dev.yml` triggers, runs an eval against
the dev environment, and deploys if it passes.

## 9. Run the Watchdog

The watchdog reads your accumulated run history and (optionally)
queries Application Insights and the Foundry control plane to flag
drifts that a single eval cannot see — repeated regressions, latency
trends, error spikes, safety findings.

```bash
pip install "agentops-toolkit[agent]"
agentops agent analyze
```

This produces `.agentops/agent/report.md`. With no `agent.yaml`
present, only the local results-history source is active and Azure
Monitor / Foundry control plane appear as `skipped` in the
diagnostics block. That is enough for the basic regression and
latency checks across all your previous runs.

To pull production telemetry, drop a starter `agent.yaml` into the
workspace and edit it:

```bash
cp "$(python -c 'import agentops, pathlib; print(pathlib.Path(agentops.__file__).parent / "templates" / "agent.yaml")')" .agentops/agent.yaml
```

```yaml
sources:
  results_history:
    enabled: true
  azure_monitor:
    enabled: true
    app_insights_resource_id: /subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/microsoft.insights/components/<ai>
  foundry_control:
    enabled: true
    project_endpoint_env: AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT
```

Re-run `agentops agent analyze`. The findings table now mixes signals
from your eval history (including the v1 → v2 tool-call regression)
with live telemetry from the deployed agent.

> **Optional — WAF-AI security audit.** The watchdog can also run a
> read-only audit of your Foundry resource group against the
> [Well-Architected Framework for AI workloads — Security pillar][waf-ai].
> Enable the `azure_resources` source and the `posture` check in
> `agent.yaml` (commented stanzas are included), grant your identity
> `Reader` on the resource group, and re-run with
> `agentops agent analyze --categories security`. Full walkthrough:
> [`tutorial-agent-watchdog.md`](tutorial-agent-watchdog.md#2b-security-posture-audit-waf-ai).

## 10. Clean up

The two agent versions live in your Foundry project until you delete
them. The helper script handles cleanup:

```bash
python scripts/create_support_agent.py delete --name support-bot
```

This removes every version (idempotent — ignores 404s).

## 11. Where to go next

You now have the full AgentOps loop running end-to-end with a real
tool-calling agent. From here:

- **Per-scenario tutorials** — adapt the dataset shape to your own
  agent:
  - [`tutorial-rag.md`](tutorial-rag.md) — retrieval-augmented agents.
  - [`tutorial-agent-workflow.md`](tutorial-agent-workflow.md) —
    focused tool-calling reference (single-tool variants, HTTP-hosted
    agents, dataset shape details).
  - [`tutorial-conversational-agent.md`](tutorial-conversational-agent.md)
    — multi-turn assistants.
  - [`tutorial-http-agent.md`](tutorial-http-agent.md) — agents
    deployed outside Foundry (ACA, AKS, custom).
  - [`tutorial-model-direct.md`](tutorial-model-direct.md) — raw
    model deployments without an agent layer.
- **Deeper baseline workflows** —
  [`tutorial-baseline-comparison.md`](tutorial-baseline-comparison.md).
- **Watchdog as a Copilot extension** —
  [`tutorial-agent-watchdog.md`](tutorial-agent-watchdog.md).
- **CI/CD reference** —
  [`ci-github-actions.md`](ci-github-actions.md).
- **Architecture and concepts** —
  [`how-it-works.md`](how-it-works.md),
  [`concepts.md`](concepts.md).
