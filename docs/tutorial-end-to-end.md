# End-to-end workshop: release readiness for Foundry agents

This workshop is the full path. Use it after one of the quickstarts when you
want to validate the complete build -> evaluate -> release -> observe loop.

It is inspired by the Azure Samples workshop
[Mind the Gap In Your AI Agent Observability](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-foundry-e2e-agent-observability-workshop/tree/2026-04-aie-europe).
That workshop goes deep on Foundry SDK notebooks, tracing, evaluation, and
red-team scans. This AgentOps workshop does not copy those labs. It shows where
AgentOps fits around the same lifecycle as the repo-side readiness and evidence
layer.

![Foundry Control Plane](media/foundry-control-plane.png)

Foundry gives you the control plane: fleet management, observability, security,
and compliance. AgentOps adds the repo contract around that control plane:
repeatable CI gates, Doctor checks, release evidence, and trace-to-regression
review.

## What you will validate

| Stage | Activity | Main tools | AgentOps role | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Define the agent goal and risks | Foundry docs, VS Code, Copilot | Helps define what must be proven before release. | Success criteria and risk list |
| 2 | Choose Prompt Agent or Hosted Agent | Foundry portal, Foundry Toolkit, team architecture | Later references the target as `name:version` or URL. | Target type decision |
| 3 | Create or deploy the agent | Foundry portal, Foundry SDK, Foundry Toolkit, Agent Framework, `microsoft-foundry` skill | No ownership of create/deploy. | Agent version or endpoint |
| 4 | Test and debug | Foundry playground, VS Code debugger, Agent Inspector, Copilot Chat | Optional quick eval after target exists. | Working dev-loop agent |
| 5 | Configure release checks | AgentOps CLI and skills | Creates `agentops.yaml` and repo-side release contract. | Release checklist in repo |
| 6 | Evaluate | Official AI Agent Evaluation or AgentOps local runner | Routes to the right runner and normalizes proof. | Eval gate signal |
| 7 | Create operations workflow | GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, azd | Generates PR, environment, and watchdog workflows. | CI/CD gates |
| 8 | Observe production | Foundry Operate, Azure Monitor, Application Insights | Checks wiring and links to official dashboards. | Traces, metrics, health |
| 9 | Review readiness | AgentOps Doctor, Cockpit, evidence pack | Answers "can we ship it, and where is the proof?" | `evidence.md` |
| 10 | Learn from traces | Foundry/App Insights exports, AgentOps trace promotion | Turns reviewed traces into regression candidates. | Future eval rows |

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI signed in with access to a Foundry project.
- A Foundry project endpoint.
- Access to create one Travel Agent target:
  - Prompt agent: `travel-agent:<version>`, or
  - Hosted/HTTP endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat` locally or a deployed
    HTTPS endpoint for CI.
- One Azure OpenAI deployment for evaluator calls, for example `gpt-4o-mini`.
- Application Insights connected to the Foundry project or agent runtime.

Install AgentOps in a clean workshop workspace:

```powershell
mkdir agentops-workshop
cd agentops-workshop
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install "agentops-toolkit[foundry,agent]" fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"
az login
```

If you need the latest unreleased changes from the repository instead of the
published package, use:

```powershell
python -m pip install "agentops-toolkit[foundry,agent] @ git+https://github.com/Azure/agentops.git@main"
```

You will provide the target values through the interactive `agentops init`
wizard. The evaluator endpoint/deployment is separate: set it only when running
local evals or configuring CI variables.

## 1. Create the Travel Agent target

Choose one path. The rest of the workshop works with either target.

### Option A: create a Prompt Agent in Foundry

1. Open the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) and select your
   project.
2. Create a prompt-based agent named `travel-agent`.
3. Use `gpt-4o-mini` or another chat-capable deployment in the project.
4. Paste these instructions:

   ```text
   You are Travel Agent, a concise travel planning assistant.

   Help users plan short leisure trips. Always include:
   - a short summary;
   - a day-by-day plan when the user asks for an itinerary;
   - practical notes about budget, transit, weather, or booking constraints;
   - a reminder that you cannot make live reservations or purchases.

   Ask one clarifying question only when the destination, duration, or traveler
   preference is missing. Do not invent booking confirmations, prices, or
   availability.
   ```

5. Save and publish the agent.
6. Set the target reference. Replace `1` if Foundry published a different
   version:

   ```powershell
   $env:TRAVEL_AGENT_TARGET = "travel-agent:1"
   ```

### Option B: create a Hosted/HTTP Travel Agent endpoint

Create a minimal HTTP agent you can run locally first and later deploy with
Foundry Toolkit, Azure Container Apps, AKS, or your normal platform.

```powershell
@'
import os

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI(title="Travel Agent")


class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    message: str


def plan_trip(message: str) -> str:
    if os.getenv("TRAVEL_AGENT_MODE") == "regressed":
        return "Travel depends on your preference. Search online and pick what looks best."

    text = message.lower()
    if "lisbon" in text:
        return (
            "Summary: Lisbon is a strong 3-day food and history trip. "
            "Day 1: Baixa, Chiado, and a sunset viewpoint. "
            "Day 2: Alfama, Sao Jorge Castle, and fado. "
            "Day 3: Belem, pastries, and a riverside walk. "
            "Notes: use transit, reserve popular restaurants early, and I cannot make live bookings."
        )
    if "seattle" in text:
        return (
            "Summary: Seattle can work well for a low-budget coffee and museum weekend. "
            "Day 1: Pike Place, waterfront, and independent coffee shops. "
            "Day 2: Museum of Pop Culture or Seattle Art Museum plus Capitol Hill. "
            "Notes: use transit, plan for rain, choose free viewpoints, and I cannot make live bookings."
        )
    if "tokyo" in text:
        return (
            "Summary: Tokyo with kids works best with short travel hops and flexible pacing. "
            "Plan: mix Ueno, Asakusa, Shibuya, teamLab or a science museum, parks, and one easy day trip. "
            "Notes: use IC transit cards, avoid overpacking each day, and I cannot make live bookings."
        )
    return (
        "Summary: I can help plan a short leisure trip. "
        "Please share the destination, trip length, budget, and traveler preferences. "
        "I cannot make live bookings."
    )


@app.post("/chat")
def chat(request: ChatRequest) -> dict[str, str]:
    return {"text": plan_trip(request.message)}
'@ | Set-Content -Encoding utf8 app.py
```

Start it in a second terminal:

```powershell
cd agentops-workshop
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Set the local target:

```powershell
$env:TRAVEL_AGENT_TARGET = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat"
```

To make this a real Foundry Hosted Agent for CI:

1. Install the
   [Foundry Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.vscode-ai-foundry).
2. Confirm the Foundry project has a deployed model and the required Hosted
   Agent permissions for your user or project identity.
3. In VS Code, run `Microsoft Foundry: Create a New Hosted Agent`.
4. Choose a single-agent template, Python or C#, and the model deployment.
5. Replace the generated instructions or source logic with the Travel Agent
   behavior from this workshop.
6. Press F5 to debug locally with Agent Inspector.
7. Run `Microsoft Foundry: Deploy Hosted Agent`.
8. Copy the deployed endpoint URL and set:

   ```powershell
   $env:TRAVEL_AGENT_TARGET = "https://<your-foundry-hosted-travel-agent-endpoint>"
   ```

If the deployed Foundry Hosted Agent follows the Responses API shape, use
`protocol: responses` in `agentops.yaml`.

If you want the notebook-style Foundry build path, follow the Azure Samples
workshop labs for creating agents, tools, tracing, evaluation, and red-team
scans:

```text
https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microsoft-foundry-e2e-agent-observability-workshop/tree/2026-04-aie-europe
```

## 2. Create the travel eval dataset

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force .agentops\data | Out-Null
@'
{"input":"Plan a 3-day first-time trip to Lisbon for a couple who likes food and history.","expected":"A concise 3-day Lisbon itinerary with food, history, neighborhoods such as Baixa, Alfama, and Belem, practical notes, and no claim to make live bookings."}
{"input":"Suggest a low-budget weekend in Seattle for a solo traveler who likes coffee and museums.","expected":"A practical weekend Seattle plan with low-budget choices, coffee and museum suggestions, transit or weather notes, and no claim to make live bookings."}
{"input":"I want to visit Tokyo for 5 days with two kids. What should we do?","expected":"A family-friendly 5-day Tokyo itinerary with kid-appropriate activities, transit and pacing notes, and no claim to make live bookings."}
'@ | Set-Content -Encoding utf8 .agentops\data\travel-smoke.jsonl
```

## 3. Initialize the repo-side release contract interactively

```powershell
agentops init
```

Answer the prompts as the wizard asks them:

| Prompt | Answer |
|---|---|
| Foundry project endpoint | `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>` |
| Agent | The value in `$env:TRAVEL_AGENT_TARGET`, such as `travel-agent:1` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat` |
| Dataset path | `.agentops/data/travel-smoke.jsonl` |

The wizard does not ask for App Insights. Later runtime commands such as eval,
Doctor, and Cockpit use the Foundry project endpoint to ask the Azure AI
Projects SDK for the App Insights resource attached to that Foundry project. If
discovery is unavailable and you want to force a value, run
`agentops init --appinsights-connection-string "<connection-string>"` or set
`APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` manually in `.azure/dev/.env`.

If the first run shows starter defaults such as `Agent [my-agent:1]` or
`Dataset path [.agentops/data/smoke.jsonl]`, replace them with your Travel Agent
target and dataset. Those defaults only come from the scaffolded starter file.

The wizard saves `agent` and `dataset` to `agentops.yaml`. It saves the Foundry
project endpoint to `.azure/dev/.env`, which is git-ignored and compatible with
azd. If you force an App Insights connection string later, it is saved there too.

For a hosted HTTP endpoint, add the endpoint protocol fields:

```yaml
protocol: http-json
request_field: message
response_field: text
```

Add `auth_header_env: HOSTED_AGENT_TOKEN` only when the deployed endpoint needs
a bearer token.

## 4. Decide the eval runner

```powershell
agentops workflow analyze --format text
```

Expected result:

| Agent target | Runner |
|---|---|
| `agent: name:version` | Microsoft Foundry AI Agent Evaluation |
| `agent: https://...` | `agentops-local` |
| `agent: model:<deployment>` | `agentops-local` |

This is the key alignment rule. Foundry-native prompt agents use the Microsoft
Foundry AI Agent Evaluation action/task where possible. AgentOps keeps the local
path for hosted endpoints, models, unsupported evaluator mappings, and
repo-specific threshold evidence.

## 5. Run the first eval

For hosted agents or local fallback:

```powershell
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = "https://<resource>.openai.azure.com"
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT = "gpt-4o-mini"
```

```powershell
agentops eval analyze
agentops eval run --output .agentops\results\manual-smoke
code .agentops\results\manual-smoke\report.md
```

For prompt agents, generate the workflow and let CI call the official runner:

```powershell
agentops workflow generate --kinds pr --force
```

Before running that workflow, set the CI variable:

```text
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-mini
```

This value is not an `agentops init` answer. It tells the Microsoft Foundry AI
Agent Evaluation runner which model deployment should judge responses.

The generated workflow prepares Microsoft Foundry eval input under:

```text
.agentops/official-eval/
```

and records release evidence after the gate.

## 6. Force a regression and recover

Run one deliberate failure before you build the release path. It makes the
workshop concrete: you compare a worse agent against a known-good run, fix it,
and rerun the same gate.

### Prompt Agent regression

1. In Foundry, edit the `travel-agent` instructions to this intentionally bad
   version:

   ```text
   Answer travel questions in one vague sentence. Do not include day-by-day
   plans, practical notes, constraints, or booking caveats.
   ```

2. Publish it as the next version, for example `travel-agent:2`.
3. Re-run the wizard and update only the agent value:

   ```powershell
   agentops init --reconfigure
   ```

   Keep the same project endpoint and dataset, but answer `Agent` with the
   regressed version.
4. Run the generated PR workflow. In Foundry Evaluations and the workflow
   summary, compare the regressed run with the previous prompt version. The
   vague prompt should lose quality because it no longer satisfies the travel
   dataset.
5. Restore the original Travel Agent instructions, publish again as a fixed
   version such as `travel-agent:3`, re-run `agentops init --reconfigure`, and
   run the pipeline again.

This exercises Foundry prompt versioning, Microsoft Foundry AI Agent Evaluation,
and AgentOps evidence for the exact version under release review.

### Hosted/HTTP regression

The sample endpoint has a regression switch. Stop the server, restart it in
regressed mode, and compare it with the first run:

```powershell
$env:TRAVEL_AGENT_MODE = "regressed"
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

```powershell
agentops eval run `
  --baseline .agentops\results\manual-smoke `
  --output .agentops\results\regressed
code .agentops\results\regressed\report.md
```

The report should show lower quality or threshold movement. Now stop the server,
remove the regression switch, restart it, and compare the fixed run:

```powershell
Remove-Item Env:\TRAVEL_AGENT_MODE -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

```powershell
agentops eval run `
  --baseline .agentops\results\regressed `
  --output .agentops\results\fixed
code .agentops\results\fixed\report.md
```

This exercises the AgentOps local runner, baseline comparison, normalized
`results.json`, and the same fix-rerun loop you put behind a PR gate.

## 7. Add CI/CD gates

Generate the common release path:

```powershell
agentops workflow generate --kinds pr,dev,qa,prod,watchdog --force
```

The generated workflows are intentionally boring:

- PR gate: evaluate and publish report/evidence.
- Dev/QA/Prod: deploy with azd or placeholders, then run readiness checks.
- Watchdog: run Doctor on a schedule and upload the report.

## 8. Wire observability

Foundry and Azure Monitor own live observability. AgentOps only checks whether
the repo and runtime are wired to those signals.

If runtime discovery does not find the connected App Insights resource, set the
connection string in the active azd env:

```powershell
agentops init show --reveal-secrets
notepad .azure\dev\.env
```

The env file should include:

```text
APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=InstrumentationKey=...
```

For custom hosted runtimes, install the `[agent]` extra and configure Azure
Monitor OpenTelemetry in the app startup. In Foundry, use the Observability
pages for trace drilldown, metrics, and Ask AI analysis.

## 9. Run Doctor and create release evidence

```powershell
agentops doctor --workspace . --evidence-pack
code .agentops\agent\report.md
code .agentops\release\latest\evidence.md
```

Open both files. The Doctor report is the diagnostic view: it tells you which
signals are present, which are missing, and whether the finding is blocking or
informational. The evidence pack is the reviewer view: it turns those signals
into a concise release artifact.

The evidence pack is not a second gate. It summarizes existing signals:

- eval gate status;
- Doctor findings;
- CI/CD readiness;
- telemetry readiness;
- trace-regression status;
- links back to Foundry and Azure Monitor.

In a fresh workshop, some findings should still be missing: production telemetry
may not have live traffic, scheduled workflows may not have history, and trace
regression candidates may not exist yet. That is useful tutorial feedback, not
a failure of Doctor.

## 10. Run Foundry red-team scans

Red-team scans are a Foundry capability. Run them from Foundry Observability /
Red Teaming or the official Foundry SDK path. AgentOps does not create or run
managed red-team scans.

Use AgentOps for the repo-side follow-through:

1. Add safety/adversarial rows to your eval dataset when there are repeatable
   cases worth gating in CI.
2. Keep the Foundry red-team scan URL or summary with the release review.
3. Re-run Doctor and evidence:

```powershell
agentops doctor --workspace . --evidence-pack
```

Cockpit links back to Foundry Red Teaming so reviewers can drill into the
managed scan results.

## 11. Promote production traces into regression candidates

Export reviewed Foundry or Application Insights traces to JSON/JSONL. Preview
the conversion first:

```powershell
agentops eval promote-traces --source .agentops\traces\candidate-traces.jsonl
```

If the rows look useful, apply them:

```powershell
agentops eval promote-traces `
  --source .agentops\traces\candidate-traces.jsonl `
  --apply
```

This writes reviewable regression candidates under `.agentops/data/`. AgentOps
does not claim they are human-approved truth. They are candidates until the team
reviews and accepts them.

## 12. Open Cockpit

```powershell
agentops cockpit --workspace .
```

Use Cockpit as the local command center:

- Foundry connection and deep links;
- Microsoft Foundry eval or AgentOps local eval gate status;
- Doctor findings;
- release evidence;
- local eval history;
- production telemetry snapshot;
- CI/CD workflow status;
- next actions.

## Completion checklist

You are ready for a release review when:

- The agent target is explicit in `agentops.yaml`.
- CI uses the expected runner for the target.
- Eval results or Microsoft Foundry eval metadata are attached to the workflow
  artifact.
- The workshop includes one deliberate regression and one fixed rerun, either
  through Foundry prompt versions or AgentOps local baseline comparison.
- `agentops doctor --evidence-pack` writes `evidence.md`.
- Application Insights is connected or the evidence clearly says it is missing.
- Foundry red-team scans are linked or tracked as a release action.
- Trace learnings have a path back into regression candidates.
