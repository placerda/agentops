# Tutorial — End-to-end with AgentOps

This is the long-form, do-it-yourself tour of AgentOps. By the end you
will have a real Foundry hosted agent with **three function tools**
under evaluation, a baseline-vs-degraded comparison that demonstrates
tool-call regression detection, four GitFlow CI/CD workflows wired to
your own GitHub repo, and a watchdog report summarising your run
history.

It takes around 60–90 minutes the first time. Every step is concrete:
you copy a command, you see an artefact, you keep moving.

> **Why a tool-calling agent?** Production agents fail in interesting
> ways: they pick the wrong tool, fabricate arguments, or skip tool
> use entirely and answer from memory. AgentOps grades all of those
> behaviours — `tool_call_accuracy`, `intent_resolution`,
> `task_adherence` — alongside text quality. A trivia chatbot would
> only exercise the latter; this tutorial uses an agent where tool
> behaviour is the point.

## What you will build

- A Foundry hosted **support agent** with three function tools:
  `lookup_order`, `refund_order`, `escalate_to_human`.
- A flat `agentops.yaml` pointing at that agent with thresholds on
  both text-quality and tool-call metrics.
- A 5-row evaluation dataset of realistic support tickets, each
  carrying `tool_definitions` and the expected `tool_calls`.
- Two evaluation runs (a tool-using **v1** baseline and a degraded
  **v2** that answers from memory) compared side-by-side. The
  baseline-vs-degraded delta shows tool-call accuracy collapse —
  exactly the kind of regression CI is meant to catch.
- Four GitFlow workflows (`pr`, `dev`, `qa`, `prod`) wired to your
  own GitHub repository, gated on threshold pass/fail.
- A watchdog report combining your run history with optional
  Application Insights telemetry.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later.
- Azure CLI (`az --version`) and `az login` working.
- An Azure AI Foundry project (`AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`).
- A model deployment in that project (`gpt-4o-mini` is enough).
- The **Azure AI User** RBAC role on the Foundry account
  (data-plane access required to create agents and call them).
- A GitHub account and the `gh` CLI (or use the web UI for pushes).
- An existing or new GitHub repo — empty is fine; we will populate it.

Set the project endpoint up front so every command picks it up.

**PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
$env:AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT = "https://<your-project>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-name>"
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT             = "https://<your-project>.openai.azure.com"
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT           = "gpt-4o-mini"
```

> **Watch out for two endpoint shapes.** The Foundry project endpoint
> uses the `*.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-name>` shape.
> The evaluator model endpoint is the Azure OpenAI data-plane host,
> usually `*.openai.azure.com`, with **no path**. If you paste the
> project URL into `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, evaluators can fail with
> `BadRequest: API version not supported`. AgentOps defaults the API
> version to a release that works against both New Foundry and classic
> Azure OpenAI; override with `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` only if your
> resource needs a specific version.

> The shell snippets in this tutorial are written for **PowerShell**.
> On macOS or Linux, use the equivalent bash/zsh syntax for environment
> variables and file commands.

## 1. Install AgentOps

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install "agentops-toolkit[foundry]"
agentops --version
```

> The `[foundry]` extra installs the Azure SDK dependencies needed by
> the helper script and by the local evaluator runtime. `azure-ai-evaluation`
> provides evaluators such as `ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator`,
> `IntentResolutionEvaluator`, `CoherenceEvaluator`, …) — without it
> `agentops eval run` exits with
> `Evaluators require the 'azure-ai-evaluation' package`.

## 2. Create the Foundry hosted support agent

The tutorial uses **three function tools** that a real support agent
would expose:

| Tool | Purpose | Required arguments |
|---|---|---|
| `lookup_order` | Look up an order's status. | `order_id` |
| `refund_order` | Refund an order. | `order_id`, `reason` |
| `escalate_to_human` | Hand the conversation to a human agent. | `category` |

Registering three tools through the portal is fiddly, so this
repository ships a small helper script,
[`scripts/create_support_agent.py`](../scripts/create_support_agent.py),
that does it in one command. **Just download the single file into the
root of your tutorial project** — there's no need to create a
`scripts/` folder, and the script has no AgentOps dependency (only
`azure-ai-projects` and `azure-identity`). Then run it from the same
folder:

```powershell
python create_support_agent.py create --name support-bot
# stdout: support-bot:1
```

The first line of stdout is the `name:version` identifier you paste
into `agentops.yaml` next. The script:

- Creates a hosted prompt agent named `support-bot`.
- Registers the three function tools above with strict JSON Schema
  parameters.
- Pins the system prompt to require tool use whenever the user asks
  about an order, a refund, or talking to a human.
- Prints `support-bot:<version>` on stdout and a friendly summary on
  stderr (including a `Registered tools:` line so you can confirm
  the attachment).

> **Why don't I see the tools in the Playground?** The Foundry
> portal's Playground tab only lists tools you added through the
> portal's **Add** button. Tools registered through the SDK (like
> these) show up under the agent's **Code** / **YAML** tab and are
> invoked at runtime — `agentops eval run` exercises them either
> way.

> **Prefer the portal?** Open
> [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) → your project → **Build →
> Agents → New agent**, register the three function tools manually
> (the script's source is the canonical schema), paste the system
> prompt from `INSTRUCTIONS_GOOD` in the script, save, and copy the
> resulting `name:version` string.

### Connect Application Insights for tracing

Wire an App Insights resource to the project once so the agent's traces
flow into Azure Monitor and AgentOps dashboard's live telemetry section
lights up. In Foundry: open the agent → **Traces** tab → **Connect** →
pick or create an Application Insights resource. Or at project scope:
project name dropdown → **Project details** → **Connected resources** →
**Add connection** → **Application Insights**. Docs:
[Set up tracing in Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/observability/how-to/trace-agent-setup).

## 3. Initialize the workspace

In an empty folder (or the GitHub repo you want to use):

```powershell
agentops init
```

You get three files:

```text
agentops.yaml                  # at the project root
.agentops/data/smoke.jsonl     # 3-row seed dataset
.gitignore                     # only if one doesn't already exist
```

`agentops init` does **not** create `.agentops/results/` (that appears on
the first `agentops eval run`) or `.github/skills/`. Coding-agent skills
live in their own command: `agentops skills install --platform copilot`
(or `claude` / `cursor`).

Open `agentops.yaml` at the project root and configure it for the
support agent:

```yaml
version: 1
agent: "support-bot:1"

dataset: .agentops/data/tickets.jsonl

thresholds:
  # Tool-calling metrics (auto-inferred from tool_definitions /
  # tool_calls in the dataset).
  tool_call_accuracy: ">=0.8"
  intent_resolution: ">=4"
  task_adherence: ">=0.8"
  # Text quality metrics.
  coherence: ">=3"
  fluency: ">=3"
  similarity: ">=3"
  # Lab-safe latency budget. Tool-calling Foundry agents can have
  # occasional cold-start / orchestration spikes during a tutorial run.
  avg_latency_seconds: "<=90"
```

The `agent: "name:version"` shape is recognised as a **Foundry hosted
agent**. AgentOps invokes it through the Foundry project endpoint
using your `az login` credentials.

## 4. Author the support-ticket dataset

Replace `.agentops/data/smoke.jsonl` with a new
`.agentops/data/tickets.jsonl` carrying five realistic support
tickets. Each row includes:

- `input` — the customer message,
- `expected` — the expected outcome in plain prose,
- `tool_definitions` — every tool the agent has access to,
- `tool_calls` — the tool the agent **should** call (or an empty
  list when the right behaviour is to answer with no tool).

The variety of intents — order lookup, refund, escalation, an
ambiguous query that should resolve to a lookup, and a casual
greeting that should *not* trigger any tool — is what gives the
evaluators something interesting to grade.

```jsonl
{"input": "Where is my order ORD-12345?", "expected": "Calls lookup_order with order_id='ORD-12345'.", "tool_definitions": [{"type": "function", "name": "lookup_order", "description": "Look up an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "refund_order", "description": "Refund an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id", "reason"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "escalate_to_human", "description": "Hand the conversation to a human.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"category": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["category"]}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call_id": "c1", "name": "lookup_order", "arguments": {"order_id": "ORD-12345"}}]}
{"input": "I want a refund for ORD-77821, it arrived broken.", "expected": "Calls refund_order with order_id='ORD-77821' and reason mentioning broken.", "tool_definitions": [{"type": "function", "name": "lookup_order", "description": "Look up an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "refund_order", "description": "Refund an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id", "reason"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "escalate_to_human", "description": "Hand the conversation to a human.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"category": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["category"]}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call_id": "c2", "name": "refund_order", "arguments": {"order_id": "ORD-77821", "reason": "arrived broken"}}]}
{"input": "Please connect me to a human about my refund — this has dragged on too long.", "expected": "Calls escalate_to_human with category='refund'.", "tool_definitions": [{"type": "function", "name": "lookup_order", "description": "Look up an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "refund_order", "description": "Refund an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id", "reason"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "escalate_to_human", "description": "Hand the conversation to a human.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"category": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["category"]}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call_id": "c3", "name": "escalate_to_human", "arguments": {"category": "refund"}}]}
{"input": "Did ORD-99001 ship yet?", "expected": "Calls lookup_order with order_id='ORD-99001'.", "tool_definitions": [{"type": "function", "name": "lookup_order", "description": "Look up an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "refund_order", "description": "Refund an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id", "reason"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "escalate_to_human", "description": "Hand the conversation to a human.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"category": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["category"]}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call_id": "c4", "name": "lookup_order", "arguments": {"order_id": "ORD-99001"}}]}
{"input": "Hi there!", "expected": "Replies with a brief greeting and does NOT call any tool.", "tool_definitions": [{"type": "function", "name": "lookup_order", "description": "Look up an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "refund_order", "description": "Refund an order.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id", "reason"]}}, {"type": "function", "name": "escalate_to_human", "description": "Hand the conversation to a human.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"category": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["category"]}}], "tool_calls": []}
```

> **Why each row repeats the full `tool_definitions`?** Each dataset
> row is evaluated independently and the evaluators that check tool
> selection / argument accuracy need the **complete** tool catalogue
> per row. Repetition is the cost of row-level isolation; in real
> projects a small Python script can stamp the same definitions into
> every row at dataset-build time.

The presence of `tool_definitions` and `tool_calls` is what auto-
selects the tool-calling evaluators on top of the standard text-
quality stack. When AgentOps loads the dataset it picks:

| Evaluator | What it grades |
|---|---|
| `ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator` | Did the agent emit the expected tool calls (name + arguments)? |
| `IntentResolutionEvaluator` | Did the agent resolve the user's intent? |
| `TaskAdherenceEvaluator` | Did the agent stick to the system prompt's tool-use rules? |
| `CoherenceEvaluator` / `FluencyEvaluator` / `SimilarityEvaluator` / `F1ScoreEvaluator` | Standard text quality. |
| `avg_latency_seconds` | End-to-end latency budget. |

> **Why is the latency budget 90 seconds?** The point of this first gate
> is to prove tool behavior, not to fail a learner because one Foundry
> row hit a transient cold-start or service-queue spike. Keep this
> tutorial gate broad, then tighten latency for your own production
> agent after you have baseline data. Step 9 shows how to use
> Application Insights and Watchdog for stricter p95 latency monitoring.

## 5. Run your first evaluation

```powershell
agentops eval run
```

The CLI:

1. Resolves the target from `agentops.yaml`.
2. Calls the Foundry hosted agent once per row, capturing both the
   final text response and the structured tool calls.
3. Runs evaluators using `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`.
4. Writes a timestamped run under `.agentops/results/<timestamp>/` and refreshes
   `.agentops/results/latest/` with a copy of it. Pass `--output <dir>` to write
   the run only to that path instead.

Open the report in VS Code (any OS, no extra tooling required) and press `Ctrl+Shift+V` to render the Markdown — tables and ✅/❌ display the same way they do on GitHub:

```powershell
code .agentops/results/latest/report.md
```

> Tip: `Ctrl+K V` opens the rendered preview side-by-side with the source.

The report has four sections you will revisit often:

- **Verdict** — one line: pass or fail.
- **Per-row transcript** — input, expected, agent response, the
  `tool_calls` the agent emitted, and every metric. The greeting
  row's transcript shows an empty `tool_calls` block — useful when
  debugging false-positive tool calls.
- **Aggregate metrics** — averages across rows.
- **Thresholds** — every rule from `agentops.yaml` with measured
  value. With v1 you should see the tool-calling and text-quality
  thresholds in the green. If latency is high but below the lab-safe
  budget, keep going; you will inspect production-style p95 latency
  with Watchdog later.

The exit code is `0` (all thresholds passed) or `2` (one or more
failed). `1` means a runtime error.

## 6. Compare against a degraded baseline

This is where the tutorial earns its keep. AgentOps writes every run to a
timestamped folder under `.agentops/results/` and refreshes
`.agentops/results/latest/` with a copy. The v1 run you just executed
is still on disk — you don't need to copy or re-run anything to use it
as the baseline. Just point `--baseline` at the previous run when you
execute v2:

- `.agentops/results/latest/results.json` works as a shorthand for
  "the run before this one" (AgentOps loads it into memory before
  refreshing `latest/`).
- For a stable, named reference you can also point at a specific
  timestamp folder, e.g.
  `.agentops/results/2026-05-06T20-13-21Z/results.json`.

Now create a **degraded** version of the agent — same model, no
tools, plain-text-only instructions — so the regression demo has
something to detect:

```powershell
python create_support_agent.py create `
  --name support-bot `
  --variant v2-degraded
# stdout: support-bot:2
```

Update `agentops.yaml`:

```yaml
agent: "support-bot:2"
```

Re-run with the v1 result as the baseline:

```powershell
agentops eval run --baseline .agentops/results/latest/results.json
```

Then open the new report:

```powershell
code .agentops/results/latest/report.md
```

Press `Ctrl+Shift+V` to render the Markdown.

The new `report.md` adds a **Comparison vs Baseline** section with
per-metric deltas. Because v2 has **no tools attached at all**, the
agent literally cannot call `lookup_order`, `refund_order`, or
`escalate_to_human` — every order-specific row degrades to a
plain-text apology. You should see roughly:

| Metric | Baseline (v1) | Current (v2) | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tool_call_accuracy` | high (≈ 5) | **collapses to `n/a` / floor** | 🔴 regressed |
| `intent_resolution` | high (≈ 4–5) | **drops noticeably** | 🔴 regressed |
| `task_adherence` | mid–high | **drops to floor (1.0)** | 🔴 regressed |
| `coherence` | ≈ 4 | ≈ 4 | ⚪ unchanged |
| `fluency` | ≈ 4 | ≈ 4 | ⚪ unchanged |
| `similarity` | ≈ 3 | ≈ 3 | ⚪ unchanged |

Text quality barely moves — the degraded agent is still articulate
and on-topic — but the tool-related metrics collapse, the verdict
flips to fail, and the run exits `2`. **This is the regression-detection
loop you will wire into CI next.**

> Exact numbers will jitter run-to-run because the evaluators
> themselves are model-graded, and metrics like `task_adherence` use
> an ordinal 1–5 scale (1.0 is the floor, not 0). What matters is the
> *shape* of the delta: tool/task metrics down, text-quality metrics
> flat.

Before wiring the workflow gate, switch `agentops.yaml` back to the
tool-using version (`support-bot:1` in the example above) if you want
the PR check to pass. Leave it on the degraded version only when you
intentionally want to demonstrate a red quality gate.

## 7. Generate the GitFlow workflows

```powershell
agentops workflow generate
```

Five files appear under `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `agentops-pr.yml` | Pull request opened against `develop` or `main` | Runs `agentops eval run` against the baseline; comments the report on the PR; gates merge on threshold pass/fail. |
| `agentops-deploy-dev.yml` | Push to `develop` | Deploys to the **dev** environment after a passing eval. |
| `agentops-deploy-qa.yml` | Push to a `release/*` branch | Deploys to **qa**. |
| `agentops-deploy-prod.yml` | Push to `main` | Deploys to **prod** after a passing eval. |
| `agentops-watchdog.yml` | Daily cron + `workflow_dispatch` | Runs `agentops doctor` against the run history and uploads the report as an artifact. |

Read [`ci-github-actions.md`](ci-github-actions.md) for the full
reference. The defaults are sane: you do not need to edit them yet.

## 8. Push to GitHub and watch it run

Initialize the repo and push. Pick a unique suffix (your initials, a
date, anything) so the repo and the app registration you create later
don't collide with someone else running this same tutorial:

```powershell
$suffix = "<your-initials-or-date>"   # e.g. "pl-20260507"
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "feat: bootstrap AgentOps eval and CI/CD"
gh repo create "support-bot-$suffix" --public --source=. --push
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop
```

> **Prefer the portal?** Create the repo at
> [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) named `support-bot-<suffix>`,
> then push from your terminal:
> `git remote add origin https://github.com/<owner>/support-bot-<suffix>.git && git push -u origin main && git push -u origin develop`.

### Wire the GitHub Environments

At this point the eval works on your machine because your local Azure
login has access to Foundry and to the evaluator model. GitHub Actions is
a different machine, so you must give the workflow its own identity and
permissions.

The three workflows (`pr`, `deploy-dev`, `deploy-qa`, `deploy-prod`)
expect one GitHub **environment** per stage. Each environment stores the
variables the workflow needs and maps to one trusted Azure identity.

| Piece | Why you need it |
|---|---|
| App registration + service principal | The Azure identity that GitHub Actions will impersonate. |
| GitHub environment variables | Non-secret configuration such as tenant, subscription, Foundry endpoint, and evaluator model endpoint. |
| Federated credential | The trust rule that allows GitHub OIDC tokens from this repo/environment to become Azure tokens. |
| Azure role assignments | The actual permissions to read the Foundry agent and call the Azure OpenAI judge model. |

Think of the setup in two layers:

1. **Authentication:** GitHub proves "this workflow is running from your
   `support-bot-*` repo in the `dev`, `qa`, or `prod` environment".
2. **Authorization:** Azure checks whether that identity has roles on the
   Foundry and Azure OpenAI resources.

The next four snippets create everything end-to-end. Run them in order
from the same PowerShell session you used above (so `$suffix` is still
in scope).

#### 1. Create the app registration GitHub will impersonate

This creates the Azure identity used by the workflows. There is no client
secret in this tutorial: GitHub will authenticate with OIDC instead of a
stored password.

The command prints three values you will store as GitHub environment
variables:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` — which app registration GitHub should impersonate.
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` — which Microsoft Entra tenant owns the app.
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` — which Azure subscription the workflow should use.

```powershell
$app    = az ad app create --display-name "support-bot-ci-$suffix" | ConvertFrom-Json
az ad sp create --id $app.appId | Out-Null
$client = $app.appId
$tenant = az account show --query tenantId -o tsv
$sub    = az account show --query id -o tsv
Write-Host "AZURE_CLIENT_ID       = $client"
Write-Host "AZURE_TENANT_ID       = $tenant"
Write-Host "AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = $sub"
```

> **Notes**
> - **One app registration vs many.** This tutorial uses a single app
>   registration shared across `dev`, `qa`, and `prod` to keep the
>   walkthrough short. In production you typically create **one app
>   registration per environment** so you can grant least-privilege
>   roles per stage and rotate them independently.
> - **No CLI? Use the portal.** Create the app under **Microsoft Entra
>   ID → App registrations → New registration**, then set
>   `$client = "<application-client-id>"` manually before running the
>   next snippet.

#### 2. Create the three environments and push the variables

GitHub environments give each stage its own variable scope and its own
OIDC subject (`environment:dev`, `environment:qa`, `environment:prod`).
The PR gate intentionally runs in `dev`, so it reuses the same variables
and identity as the first deployment stage.

This snippet creates the environments and stores the values the generated
workflows read through `vars.*`:

| Variable | Where it comes from | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | `az account show` | Tells `azure/login` which Entra tenant to authenticate against. |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | `az account show` | Selects the Azure subscription for the workflow. |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | The app registration from step 1 | Tells `azure/login` which identity GitHub should impersonate. |
| `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | Your local env var | Tells AgentOps where the hosted support agent lives. |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | Your local env var | Tells evaluators where the judge model endpoint is. |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` | The deployment name, e.g. `gpt-4o-mini` | Tells evaluators which judge model deployment to call. |

```powershell
$foundry = $env:AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT
$aoai    = $env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
$deploy  = "gpt-4o-mini"
$repo    = gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner

foreach ($envName in @("dev","qa","prod")) {
  gh api -X PUT "repos/$repo/environments/$envName" | Out-Null
  gh variable set AZURE_TENANT_ID                    --env $envName --body $tenant
  gh variable set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID              --env $envName --body $sub
  gh variable set AZURE_CLIENT_ID                    --env $envName --body $client
  gh variable set AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT  --env $envName --body $foundry
  gh variable set AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT              --env $envName --body $aoai
  gh variable set AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT            --env $envName --body $deploy
  Write-Host "Configured environment: $envName"
}
```

> **Prefer the portal?** Open your repo on github.com → **Settings →
> Environments → New environment** and create `dev`, `qa`, and `prod`.
> For each one, click **Add variable** and add the six variables listed
> above.

#### 3. Add federated credentials so Azure trusts GitHub OIDC

The variables above tell GitHub which Azure identity to use, but Azure
still needs to trust this repository. A federated credential is that trust
rule.

Each credential says: "Accept tokens issued by GitHub for this exact repo
and this exact environment." That is why the `subject` values include
`environment:dev`, `environment:qa`, and `environment:prod`.

The PR gate workflow runs **inside the `dev` environment**, so it inherits
the same `dev` variables and OIDC subject — no separate `pull_request`
credential is needed.

The JSON is written to a temp file because `az` does not parse inline JSON
reliably under PowerShell:

```powershell
$subjects = @{
  "dev"  = "repo:${repo}:environment:dev"
  "qa"   = "repo:${repo}:environment:qa"
  "prod" = "repo:${repo}:environment:prod"
}

foreach ($name in $subjects.Keys) {
  $payload = [ordered]@{
    name      = "github-$name"
    issuer    = "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
    subject   = $subjects[$name]
    audiences = @("api://AzureADTokenExchange")
  }
  $tmp = New-TemporaryFile
  $payload | ConvertTo-Json | Set-Content -Path $tmp -Encoding utf8

  az ad app federated-credential create --id $client --parameters "@$tmp" | Out-Null
  Remove-Item $tmp
  Write-Host "Added federated credential: $name"
}
```

> **Prefer the portal?** Open **Microsoft Entra ID → App registrations
> → support-bot-ci-$suffix → Certificates & secrets → Federated
> credentials → Add credential**. Pick **GitHub Actions deploying Azure
> resources** as the scenario, then create one credential per subject
> in the table above (`environment:dev`, `environment:qa`,
> `environment:prod`).

#### 4. Grant the app the roles it needs

OIDC only proves the workflow's identity; it does not grant access by
itself. This step assigns least-privilege Azure roles to the service
principal:

| Scope | Role | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Foundry account/project resource | `Azure AI User` | Lets AgentOps read and invoke the hosted support agent. |
| Azure OpenAI account | `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` | Lets the evaluators call the judge model deployment. |

The endpoint URLs contain the Azure resource names, but role assignments
need full Azure resource IDs. The first half of the script extracts those
names and resolves them to IDs; the second half assigns the roles.

```powershell
$spId = az ad sp show --id $client --query id -o tsv

# Resolve resource IDs from the endpoint URLs (no need to know the RG).
$foundryName = (($env:AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT -split "//")[1] -split "\.")[0]
$aoaiName    = (($env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT -split "//")[1] -split "\.")[0]

$foundryId = az resource list --name $foundryName `
  --resource-type "Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts" --query "[0].id" -o tsv
$aoaiId    = az resource list --name $aoaiName `
  --resource-type "Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts" --query "[0].id" -o tsv

if (-not $foundryId) { throw "Could not resolve Foundry resource id for '$foundryName'" }
if (-not $aoaiId)    { throw "Could not resolve Azure OpenAI resource id for '$aoaiName'" }

# Foundry project — read agents and runs
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id $spId `
  --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal `
  --role "Azure AI User" --scope $foundryId | Out-Null

# Azure OpenAI — call the judge model
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id $spId `
  --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal `
  --role "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" --scope $aoaiId | Out-Null

Write-Host "Roles granted on Foundry project and Azure OpenAI."
```

> **Prefer the portal?** Open your Foundry project resource → **Access
> control (IAM) → Add role assignment**, pick **Azure AI User**, and
> assign it to the `support-bot-ci-$suffix` app. Repeat on the Azure
> OpenAI resource with the **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role.

### Open a PR

```powershell
git checkout -b feature/tweak-prompt
# make any small change, e.g. edit tickets.jsonl
git commit -am "test: refine ticket dataset"
git push -u origin feature/tweak-prompt
gh pr create --base develop --fill
```

The `agentops-pr.yml` workflow runs. When it finishes you will see:

- A green or red check on the PR.
- A bot comment with the verdict, threshold table (including the
  tool-call metrics), and a link to the full `report.md` artifact.
  The tutorial's latency threshold is intentionally broad; after a few
  real runs, tighten it in `agentops.yaml` or enforce p95 latency with
  Watchdog in step 9.

Merge the PR. `agentops-deploy-dev.yml` triggers, runs an eval against
the dev environment, and deploys if it passes.

## 9. Run the Watchdog

The watchdog is only useful if it has real signals to inspect. In this
tutorial those signals are:

1. `.agentops/results/*/results.json` from the evals you already ran.
2. Application Insights telemetry emitted by a new eval run.
3. Foundry control-plane metadata for the hosted support agent.

If you run `agentops doctor` without Application Insights
configured, the report can only say `azure_monitor: skipped`. That is not
an observability tutorial. The next commands create Application Insights,
send telemetry into it, and then run the watchdog against the live data.

### 9.1 Create Application Insights for the tutorial

```powershell
# Reuse the same resource group/location as the Foundry account.
$foundryName = (($env:AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT -split "//")[1] -split "\.")[0]
$foundry = az resource list `
  --name $foundryName `
  --resource-type "Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts" `
  --query "[0]" | ConvertFrom-Json

if (-not $foundry) { throw "Could not resolve Foundry resource '$foundryName'" }

$resourceGroup = ($foundry.id -split "/resourceGroups/")[1].Split("/")[0]
$location      = $foundry.location
$workspaceName = "law-support-bot-$suffix"
$appiName      = "appi-support-bot-$suffix"

az extension add -n application-insights --upgrade | Out-Null
az monitor log-analytics workspace create `
  --resource-group $resourceGroup `
  --workspace-name $workspaceName `
  --location $location | Out-Null

$workspaceId = az monitor log-analytics workspace show `
  --resource-group $resourceGroup `
  --workspace-name $workspaceName `
  --query id -o tsv

az monitor app-insights component create `
  --app $appiName `
  --location $location `
  --resource-group $resourceGroup `
  --workspace $workspaceId `
  --application-type web | Out-Null

$appInsightsId = az monitor app-insights component show `
  --app $appiName `
  --resource-group $resourceGroup `
  --query id -o tsv

$appInsightsConnectionString = az monitor app-insights component show `
  --app $appiName `
  --resource-group $resourceGroup `
  --query connectionString -o tsv
```

What this creates:

- A **Log Analytics workspace** that stores the telemetry tables.
- A workspace-based **Application Insights component** that receives
  AgentOps spans and exposes them to Azure Monitor queries.
- Two local variables:
  - `$appInsightsId` — used by the watchdog to query telemetry.
  - `$appInsightsConnectionString` — used by `agentops eval run` to emit
    telemetry.

### 9.2 Let the CI identity read telemetry

Locally, your signed-in Azure user can usually query the resource because
you created it. For GitHub Actions, grant the same OIDC app a read role
so scheduled watchdog runs can query Application Insights too:

```powershell
$repo = gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
$client = gh variable get AZURE_CLIENT_ID --env dev --repo $repo
$spId = az ad sp show --id $client --query id -o tsv

az role assignment create `
  --assignee-object-id $spId `
  --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal `
  --role "Monitoring Reader" `
  --scope $appInsightsId | Out-Null
```

### 9.3 Configure the watchdog

Now write `.agentops/agent.yaml`. This is the file that tells the
watchdog which signal sources to use. In addition to eval history,
Application Insights, and Foundry metadata, this tutorial enables the
read-only WAF-AI security posture audit for the Azure AI account:

```powershell
$env:AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = az account show --query id -o tsv
$cognitiveAccount = az cognitiveservices account list `
  --resource-group $resourceGroup `
  --query "[?kind=='AIServices' || kind=='OpenAI'].name | [0]" `
  -o tsv

if (-not $cognitiveAccount) {
  throw "No AIServices/OpenAI account found in resource group $resourceGroup"
}

@"
version: 1
lookback_days: 7

sources:
  results_history:
    enabled: true
    path: .agentops/results
    lookback_runs: 10
  azure_monitor:
    enabled: true
    app_insights_resource_id: $appInsightsId
  foundry_control:
    enabled: true
    project_endpoint_env: AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT
  azure_resources:
    enabled: true
    subscription_id_env: AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
    resource_group: $resourceGroup
    cognitive_services_account: $cognitiveAccount
checks:
  latency:
    p95_threshold_seconds: 5.0
  errors:
    rate_threshold: 0.05
  posture:
    enabled: true
    pillar: security
    exclude_rules: []
"@ | Set-Content .agentops/agent.yaml -Encoding utf8
```

If your resource group or account name is different, list candidates with:

```powershell
az cognitiveservices account list `
  --resource-group $resourceGroup `
  --query "[].{name:name,kind:kind,location:location,disableLocalAuth:properties.disableLocalAuth,publicNetworkAccess:properties.publicNetworkAccess}" `
  -o table
```

### 9.4 Generate telemetry, then analyze it

Install both the Foundry runtime and the watchdog extras, set the
Application Insights connection string, and run one more eval. AgentOps
will emit OpenTelemetry spans for each dataset row and agent invocation.

```powershell
python -m pip install "agentops-toolkit[foundry,agent]"

$env:APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING = $appInsightsConnectionString
agentops eval run

# Azure Monitor ingestion is asynchronous. Give it a short moment to index.
Start-Sleep -Seconds 90

agentops doctor
code .agentops/agent/report.md

# Optional: focus only on WAF-AI security posture.
agentops doctor --categories security --severity-fail critical
```

The report should now show `azure_monitor` and `azure_resources` as `ok`,
not `skipped`. The watchdog can combine:

- eval-history regressions from `.agentops/results`;
- live p95 latency and error-rate signals from Application Insights;
- Foundry control-plane metadata from `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`;
- WAF-AI security posture findings from the Cognitive Services / Azure
  OpenAI account.

If the findings table is empty, that means the configured checks passed;
the **Sources** table still proves which signal sources were queried.

In the tutorial test environment, the posture-only run produced two
warnings: missing diagnostic settings and unrestricted public network
access on the AI Services account. Full walkthrough:
[`tutorial-agent-watchdog.md`](tutorial-agent-watchdog.md#3-security-posture-audit-waf-ai).

## 10. Clean up

The two agent versions live in your Foundry project until you delete
them. The helper script handles cleanup:

```powershell
python create_support_agent.py delete --name support-bot
```

This removes every version (idempotent — ignores 404s).

## 11. Where to go next

You now have the full AgentOps loop running end-to-end with a real
tool-calling agent. From here:

  agent:
  - [`tutorial-rag.md`](tutorial-rag.md) — retrieval-augmented agents.
  - [`tutorial-agent-workflow.md`](tutorial-agent-workflow.md) —
    focused tool-calling reference (single-tool variants, HTTP-hosted
    agents, dataset shape details).

    — multi-turn assistants.
  - [`tutorial-http-agent.md`](tutorial-http-agent.md) — agents
    deployed outside Foundry (ACA, AKS, custom).
