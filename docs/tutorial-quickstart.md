# Tutorial: minimal quickstart

This tutorial covers the simplest end-to-end AgentOps flow: create a
small Foundry prompt agent, bootstrap an AgentOps workspace, run a
baseline evaluation, intentionally change the agent prompt, and compare
the new run against the baseline.

> Looking for the long-form, do-it-yourself tour that also covers
> a real tool-calling support agent, baseline comparison, GitFlow
> CI/CD, and the watchdog agent? See
> [tutorial-end-to-end.md](tutorial-end-to-end.md).

## What you will build

- A Foundry prompt agent with deterministic smoke-test instructions.
- A flat `agentops.yaml` at your project root.
- A small JSONL dataset.
- A baseline `agentops eval run` producing `results.json` and `report.md`.
- A second run compared against the baseline so the report shows prompt
  quality deltas.
- A watchdog analysis (`agentops agent analyze`) that surfaces
  regressions across the run history.
- A live local dashboard (`agentops dashboard`) that visualises eval
  trends, quality metrics, and production telemetry pulled from the
  Foundry project's Application Insights.
- CI/CD workflows for GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps Pipelines
  (`agentops workflow generate`) including a daily watchdog cron.

The former bundle-based, multi-file workspace has been replaced by this flat `agentops.yaml` workflow for the common case.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later.
- Permission to create or edit a **Foundry prompt agent** and publish a
  version identified by `name:version` (for example `quickstart-agent:1`).
- The Foundry project endpoint URL.
- For AI-assisted evaluators (Coherence, Groundedness, etc.): an Azure OpenAI endpoint and deployment to use as the judge model.
- `az login` working against the tenant that owns the Foundry project
  (the CLI uses it as a credential fallback when no env vars are set).

## 1. Install

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install --upgrade "agentops-toolkit[foundry,agent]"
agentops --version
```

The `[foundry]` extra brings the Azure SDKs the eval path needs;
`[agent]` adds the FastAPI/uvicorn runtime used by `agentops dashboard`
later in the tutorial. Installing both upfront avoids a second
`pip install` later.

## 2. Bootstrap the project

```powershell
agentops init
```

This creates two files:

- `agentops.yaml` — your evaluation config (3 lines + comments).
- `.agentops/data/smoke.jsonl` — a 3-row seed dataset with short,
  deterministic factual answers.

## 3. Create the smoke-test Foundry agent

In Azure AI Foundry, create a prompt agent named `quickstart-agent` with
your preferred model deployment. Paste this exact instruction into the
agent's **Instructions** field, then save and publish it:

```text
You are the AgentOps quickstart smoke-test agent.

For every user message:
- If the message starts with "Answer with exactly this sentence:", copy
  only the sentence after that prefix.
- Do not add greetings, markdown, citations, caveats, or explanations.
- Preserve punctuation, capitalization, and wording exactly.
- If the message does not use that prefix, answer briefly and factually
  in one sentence.
```

Copy the published `name:version` value from Foundry, for example
`quickstart-agent:2`. Foundry's portal saves the first published version
as **v2** (v1 is reserved for the empty draft), so your baseline will
normally be `:2`, not `:1`. This prompt is intentionally strict because
the seed dataset checks whether the agent can follow exact-output
instructions.

## 4. Connect Application Insights for tracing

AgentOps reads live production telemetry (invocations, error rate, P95
latency, tokens) from the Application Insights resource your Foundry
project is wired to. Wire it once and the dashboard, watchdog, and
report tooling all pick it up automatically.

In the Foundry portal:

1. Open the `quickstart-agent` agent.
2. Click the **Traces** tab.
3. Click **Connect** on the banner *Create or connect an App Insights
   resource to enable tracing*.
4. Pick an existing Application Insights resource (or create a new one),
   then **Connect**.

You can also wire it at project scope from the project name dropdown
(top-left) → **Project details** → **Connected resources** → **Add
connection** → **Application Insights**. Both paths write the same
project-level setting, so you only need to do it once.

After this step the `agentops dashboard` Telemetry card flips to
**App Insights** without any environment variable on your side.

## 5. Configure AgentOps

Open `agentops.yaml` and set `agent:` to your Foundry prompt agent using
the `name:version` format. Use the agent name plus the published version
number shown in Foundry, without the `v` prefix. For example, an agent
named `my-agent` with published version `v2` is referenced as
`my-agent:2`.

The full minimal config is just:

```yaml
version: 1                       # schema version of agentops.yaml itself
agent: "quickstart-agent:2"        # ':2' is the Foundry agent version
dataset: .agentops/data/smoke.jsonl
execution: cloud                 # Foundry runs the agent + evaluators server-side
```

Field reference:

| Field | Values | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `execution` | `local` (default) / `cloud` | `local`: AgentOps invokes the agent row-by-row. `cloud`: Foundry runs the agent + evaluators server-side via the OpenAI Evals API. |
| `publish` | `false` (default for local) / `true` | When `true`, results are published to Foundry. Destination is derived from `execution`: local + publish → **Classic Foundry**, cloud → **New Foundry**. |

> **`execution: cloud` always publishes.** A cloud run is hosted by
> Foundry by definition, so `publish` defaults to `true` automatically.
> Setting `publish: false` together with `execution: cloud` is rejected
> as a contradiction. If you want local-only results, use
> `execution: local` (the default).

The top-level `version: 1` is the schema version of `agentops.yaml`
(always `1` today). The trailing `:2` in `agent:` is the Foundry agent's
published version — they are independent.

> AgentOps also supports hosted Foundry endpoints, generic HTTP/JSON
> endpoints, and raw model deployments. Those are covered in the scenario
> tutorials; this quickstart keeps the path focused on a Foundry prompt
> agent.

## 6. Run the baseline evaluation

Set credentials and run. For Foundry targets, provide the project endpoint either in `agentops.yaml` as `project_endpoint:` or in `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`; if both are set, `agentops.yaml` wins for target invocation and publishing.

```powershell
az login
$env:AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT = "https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = "https://<openai-resource>.openai.azure.com"
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT = "gpt-4o-mini"
agentops eval run
```

> **Important:** run this command **without** `--baseline`. The baseline
> file does not exist yet — you are creating it in this step.

Use the Azure OpenAI data-plane endpoint for `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` (`*.openai.azure.com`, no `/api/projects/...` path), not the Foundry project endpoint.

If Azure returns `Tenant provided in token does not match resource tenant`, sign in with the tenant that owns the Foundry project:

```powershell
az login --tenant <tenant-id>
```

Outputs:

```
.agentops/results/
├── 2026-05-06T14-30-22Z/   # Timestamped run (immutable history)
│   ├── results.json
│   ├── report.md
│   └── cloud_evaluation.json   # when publish: true (Classic or New mode)
└── latest/                 # Mirror of the most recent run
    ├── results.json
    ├── report.md
    └── cloud_evaluation.json   # when publish: true (Classic or New mode)
```

With `publish: false`, AgentOps writes only `results.json` and `report.md`. With `publish: true`, AgentOps also publishes to Foundry: `execution: local` uploads metrics to Classic Foundry; `execution: cloud` triggers a server-side run on New Foundry. Either way, `cloud_evaluation.json` records the portal URL.

To view the report rendered (tables, ✅/❌), open it in VS Code and press `Ctrl+Shift+V`:

```powershell
code .agentops/results/latest/report.md
```

The seed dataset asks the target to answer with exact short factual
sentences. The prompt from step 3 is designed to pass this smoke test, so
this first successful run is your baseline.

**Capture the baseline now** — the comparison run in step 7 requires
this file to exist:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force .agentops\baseline | Out-Null
Copy-Item .agentops\results\latest\results.json .agentops\baseline\results.json
```

The CLI prints `Threshold status: PASSED` (exit code `0`) or `FAILED` (exit code `2`) so you can wire it into CI directly.

## 7. Change the prompt and compare against the baseline

Before running the comparison, make a real prompt change so the report
has something visible to measure. In Foundry, replace the agent
instructions with this intentionally degraded prompt, then save and
publish a new version:

```text
You are a friendly educational assistant.

For every answer:
- Do not copy the user's requested sentence verbatim.
- Paraphrase the answer in your own words.
- Add one extra sentence of helpful context.
- Use a warm, conversational tone.
```

Update `agentops.yaml` to the new published version (the next number
after your baseline — typically `:3`):

```yaml
version: 1
agent: "quickstart-agent:3"
dataset: .agentops/data/smoke.jsonl
execution: cloud
```

Now compare the changed prompt against the captured baseline:

```powershell
agentops eval run --baseline .agentops/baseline/results.json
```

The comparison should show visible deltas because the baseline prompt
copied the exact expected sentences while the new prompt deliberately
paraphrases and adds extra text. Expect `similarity` and `f1_score` to
drop, while latency may vary normally.

`report.md` now includes a `Comparison vs Baseline` section with per-metric deltas (🟢 improved / 🔴 regressed / ⚪ unchanged).

For normal local iteration you can also use
`.agentops/results/latest/results.json` as the baseline path. AgentOps
loads the baseline before refreshing `latest/`, so that path means "the
run before this one".

## 8. Run the AgentOps watchdog agent

So far the loop is reactive: someone ran an eval and decided whether the
delta was acceptable. The **watchdog agent** is the AgentOps service that
turns the same run history into a written report — categorised findings,
severity, suggested remediations — so you can see how the project is
trending without opening every `results.json` by hand.

You already have at least two runs in `.agentops/results/` (the baseline
and the comparison). Point the watchdog at the workspace:

```powershell
agentops agent analyze --workspace . --out .agentops/agent/report.md
```

It reads every run under `.agentops/results/`, applies the rules defined
in the workspace `agent.yaml` (regression detection, threshold drift,
latency spikes, …) and emits a single Markdown report. Open it the same
way as the eval report:

```powershell
code .agentops/agent/report.md
```

The CLI returns:

- `0` — no findings at or above the `--severity-fail` threshold (default `critical`).
- `2` — at least one finding at that severity (use this in CI to fail
  noisily on regressions).
- `1` — runtime/config error.

The watchdog is the bridge between "one eval ran" and "the project's
quality is healthy". Wire `agentops agent analyze` into the CI workflow
generated below to get the same view automatically on every PR.

> **Tip — local dashboard.** Every analyze run also appends a record to
> `.agentops/agent/history.jsonl`. Run `agentops dashboard` (in a separate
> terminal) to open a dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8090 that shows the
> counts and sparklines without opening every report.md by hand. The
> dashboard is read-only and requires no Azure resource.

### Auditing the agent in App Insights

Whenever `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` is set (it already is, for
cloud execution), AgentOps **auto-discovers** the Application Insights
resource attached to the Foundry project and emits OpenTelemetry traces
there — no extra environment variable required. The `agentops dashboard`
dashboard's *Telemetry* card surfaces "App Insights (auto-discovered)"
plus a one-click link to the Logs blade.

Once you've run an `agentops eval run` or `agentops agent analyze`, you
can inspect the spans directly in the Foundry project's App Insights:

```kusto
union dependencies, requests, traces
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| where name has "ANALYZE" or name has "RUN " or name has "eval_item"
   or name has "invoke_agent" or name has "evaluator" or name has "chat"
| project timestamp, itemType, name, success, duration, customDimensions
| order by timestamp desc
| take 100
```

Useful slices once data is flowing:

```kusto
// Pass rate by agent version over the last 7 days.
requests
| where timestamp > ago(7d)
| where name startswith "RUN "
| extend agent = tostring(customDimensions["agentops.eval.target"])
| summarize passed = countif(success == true), total = count() by agent
| extend pass_rate = round(100.0 * passed / total, 1)
| order by total desc
```

```kusto
// Per-evaluator score distribution for the latest run.
dependencies
| where timestamp > ago(2h)
| where name startswith "evaluator"
| extend score = todouble(customDimensions["agentops.eval.evaluator.score"])
| extend evaluator = tostring(customDimensions["agentops.eval.evaluator.builtin"])
| summarize avg_score = avg(score), runs = count() by evaluator
| order by avg_score asc
```

### Scheduling the watchdog

Running `agentops agent analyze` manually is fine for the smoke test,
but the watchdog earns its keep when it runs on a schedule. Two options:

**(a) CI cron (recommended for shared repos):** generate the watchdog
workflow that ships with AgentOps:

```powershell
agentops workflow generate --kinds watchdog
# or for Azure DevOps Pipelines:
agentops workflow generate --platform azure-devops --kinds watchdog
```

This writes a daily-cron workflow (`agentops-watchdog.yml`) that
checks out the repo, restores the previous run's `history.jsonl` from
the pipeline artifact, runs `agentops agent analyze`, and re-uploads
the updated history. Trend data persists across runners.

**(b) Local Task Scheduler / cron (single developer machine):** drop
into Windows Task Scheduler or a Linux `crontab -e` and add
`agentops agent analyze --workspace <path>` on the cadence you want
(hourly, daily). Combine with `agentops dashboard` left running and the
dashboard refreshes itself.

### Security posture (WAF AI Security pillar)

The watchdog's posture check can audit your Foundry project resources
against the Well-Architected Framework's AI Security pillar — managed
identity instead of API keys, customer-managed encryption, private
networking, content safety enabled, etc. To enable it, edit
`.agentops/agent.yaml` and turn on the `azure_resources` source:

```yaml
sources:
  results_history:
    enabled: true
  azure_resources:
    enabled: true
    subscription_id: "<your-sub-id>"
    resource_group: "<your-rg>"
```

Then re-run `agentops agent analyze`. Posture findings appear under the
`security` category with WAF rule ids you can grep for, and the
dashboard's *Security* card lights up if anything regressed since the
last analysis.

## 9. Generate the CI/CD workflows

The eval loop is most useful when it runs automatically on every pull
request and deploy. `agentops workflow generate` writes a complete
GitFlow scaffold — a PR gate plus three deploy stages
(dev / qa / production) — that you can commit to your repo verbatim.

You can target **GitHub Actions** (default) or **Azure DevOps
Pipelines**. The conceptual workflows are identical across platforms;
the only difference is the YAML dialect and where the files land.

**GitHub Actions:**

```powershell
agentops workflow generate
```

writes:

```
.github/workflows/
├── agentops-pr.yml            # PR gate (PRs to develop, release/**, main)
├── agentops-deploy-dev.yml    # push to develop  → environment: dev
├── agentops-deploy-qa.yml     # push to release/** → environment: qa
├── agentops-deploy-prod.yml   # push to main      → environment: production
└── agentops-watchdog.yml      # daily cron → runs `agentops agent analyze`
```

**Azure DevOps Pipelines:**

```powershell
agentops workflow generate --platform azure-devops
```

writes:

```
.azuredevops/pipelines/
├── agentops-pr.yml
├── agentops-deploy-dev.yml
├── agentops-deploy-qa.yml
├── agentops-deploy-prod.yml
└── agentops-watchdog.yml
```

Each workflow installs AgentOps, runs `agentops eval run`, uploads the
results as a pipeline artifact, and (for the PR gate) posts the
rendered `report.md` as an idempotent PR comment.

For the quickstart you don't have to commit these files yet — opening
them locally shows what AgentOps will run in CI:

```powershell
code .github/workflows/agentops-pr.yml          # GitHub
code .azuredevops/pipelines/agentops-pr.yml     # Azure DevOps
```

Useful flags:

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--platform` | `github` | `github` or `azure-devops`. |
| `--kinds` | all four | Comma-separated subset, e.g. `--kinds pr,dev`. Use `--kinds pr` for the safest first commit. |
| `--force` | off | Overwrite existing workflow files. |
| `--dir` | `.` | Repo root directory. |

The `agentops-workflow` Copilot skill walks you through the rest
(environments, Azure auth, branch protection / approvals) when you're
ready to push the workflows to your repo.

## Where evaluators come from

You did not pick evaluators — AgentOps inferred them:

- **Always:** Coherence, Fluency, Similarity, F1Score.
- **`execution: local` only:** `avg_latency_seconds` (client-perceived
  latency, measured during the row-by-row local invocation). In
  `execution: cloud`, runtime evaluators are skipped because the agent
  never runs on your machine, so the latency the CLI prints is
  Foundry-side instead.
- **If your dataset rows include `context`:** Groundedness, Relevance, Retrieval, ResponseCompleteness.
- **If your dataset rows include `tool_calls` or `tool_definitions`:** TaskCompletion, ToolCallAccuracy, IntentResolution, TaskAdherence.

To override the auto-selection, list evaluator class names in `agentops.yaml`:

```yaml
evaluators:
  - GroundednessEvaluator
  - CoherenceEvaluator
```

## Where to go next

- [`docs/how-it-works.md`](how-it-works.md) — architecture and request flow.
- [`docs/ci-github-actions.md`](ci-github-actions.md) — wire AgentOps into PR checks with OIDC auth.
- The scenario tutorials use the same flat `agentops.yaml` workflow with more realistic datasets and targets.
