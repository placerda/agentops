description: Set up the full GenAIOps GitFlow CI/CD scaffold for an AgentOps project. Generates four CI/CD workflows (PR gate + Deploy DEV / QA / PROD) for either GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps Pipelines, wired to environment approvals, Azure auth, and AgentOps eval gating. Trigger on "CI", "CD", "pipeline", "workflow", "GitHub Actions", "Azure DevOps", "ADO", "PR gate", "deploy", "environments", "GitFlow", "release branch", "promote to prod", "DevOps", "GenAIOps pipeline".

# AgentOps Workflow

Help the user wire AgentOps into a real GenAIOps GitFlow CI/CD setup with
three environments (`dev`, `qa`, `production`), automatic eval gates, and
release evidence for production-readiness reviews.

**Pick the platform up front.** AgentOps supports two:

- `--platform github` (default) - writes `.github/workflows/*.yml` using
  GitHub Actions. Auth via OIDC + GitHub Environments.
- `--platform azure-devops` - writes `.azuredevops/pipelines/*.yml` using
  Azure DevOps Pipelines. Auth via a Service Connection + a variable
  group named `agentops`.

The conceptual workflows are identical: one PR gate, three deploy stages
(dev/qa/prod), and a scheduled Doctor workflow. PR, production, and watchdog
templates run `agentops doctor --evidence-pack` so reviewers get
`evidence.json` and `evidence.md` in artifacts.

For a new repository or tutorial, start with the PR gate only:
`agentops workflow generate --kinds pr`. Generate DEV/QA/PROD deploy
workflows only after environments, Azure auth, and real build/deploy
commands are configured.

For copied accelerators or unfamiliar repos (for example GPT-RAG, Live Voice
Practice, AI Landing Zone/Bicep-based apps), run `agentops workflow analyze`
first and use the findings as the implementation plan before generating or
editing workflows.

AgentOps is **azd-first** for app/infrastructure deployment and
**Foundry-native** for prompt-agent deployment. Do not invent a parallel
deployment system. AgentOps should gate quality; `azd provision`, `azd
deploy`, and azd hooks should own infrastructure/app packaging, while
Foundry owns prompt-agent versions created through the Foundry SDK.

## Branch model assumed

```
feature/* ── PR ──▶ develop                 [agentops-pr]          gate
                       │
                       └── merge ─▶ develop  [agentops-deploy-dev]  build + eval + deploy DEV
release/* ── push                            [agentops-deploy-qa]   build + eval + deploy QA
release/* ── PR ──▶ main                     [agentops-pr]          gate
                       │
                       └── merge ─▶ main     [agentops-deploy-prod] safety eval + build + deploy PROD
```

If the user is on trunk-based development, omit `qa` and `release/**`
and have them generate `--kinds pr,dev,prod`.

## Step 0 - Prerequisites

1. `pip install "agentops-toolkit @ git+https://github.com/Azure/agentops.git@develop"` if `agentops` is missing.
2. `agentops eval analyze` has been reviewed, `agentops.yaml` exists at the
   project root, and `agentops eval run` works locally.
3. The user's repo follows GitFlow (or is willing to). If not, ask which
   branches map to dev/qa/prod and adjust the triggers after
   generation.

## Step 1 - Generate the workflows

First analyze the repo shape:

```bash
agentops workflow analyze
agentops workflow analyze --format markdown --out agentops-workflow-plan.md
```

Use the analysis to decide whether `--deploy-mode auto` is enough or whether
you need to adapt placeholders/project-specific deployment. The analyzer is
local-only and looks for `azure.yaml`, Bicep, AgentOps prompt-agent config,
landing-zone manifests, private-network signals, Docker/Container Apps signals,
and existing CI folders. Treat README matches as hints only; structural files
drive the recommendation.

**GitHub Actions (default):**

```bash
agentops workflow generate --kinds pr
# or full scaffold:
agentops workflow generate --kinds pr,dev,qa,prod --force
```

**Azure DevOps Pipelines:**

```bash
agentops workflow generate --platform azure-devops --kinds pr
# or full scaffold:
agentops workflow generate --platform azure-devops --kinds pr,dev,qa,prod --force
```

The full scaffold writes:

| Kind | GitHub Actions path | Azure DevOps path | Trigger | Environment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pr` | `.github/workflows/agentops-pr.yml` | `.azuredevops/pipelines/agentops-pr.yml` | PRs to `develop`, `release/**`, `main` | `dev` |
| `dev` | `.github/workflows/agentops-deploy-dev.yml` | `.azuredevops/pipelines/agentops-deploy-dev.yml` | push to `develop` | `dev` |
| `qa` | `.github/workflows/agentops-deploy-qa.yml` | `.azuredevops/pipelines/agentops-deploy-qa.yml` | push to `release/**` | `qa` |
| `prod` | `.github/workflows/agentops-deploy-prod.yml` | `.azuredevops/pipelines/agentops-deploy-prod.yml` | push to `main` | `production` |
| `watchdog` | `.github/workflows/agentops-watchdog.yml` | `.azuredevops/pipelines/agentops-watchdog.yml` | daily cron (06:00 UTC) | `dev` |

PR, PROD, and watchdog workflows upload release evidence. Explain that this is
a projection of existing eval/Doctor/Foundry/monitoring signals, not a separate
exit-code contract.

Useful flags:

- `--platform github | azure-devops` - pick the CI/CD platform.
- `--force` - overwrite existing workflow files.
- `--kinds pr,dev,qa,prod` - generate a subset. Prefer `--kinds pr`
  until deploy environments are configured.
- `--deploy-mode auto|placeholder|azd|prompt-agent` - `auto` uses azd
  templates when `azure.yaml` exists, otherwise uses prompt-agent templates
  when `agentops.yaml` targets a Foundry prompt agent; `azd` forces
  `azd provision` / `azd deploy`; `prompt-agent` stages/evaluates a Foundry
  prompt candidate; `placeholder` keeps the generic stack-agnostic scaffold.
- `--dir <path>` - non-default repo root.

## Step 2 - Configure environments and Azure auth

### GitHub Actions

Walk the user through Settings → Environments and create three:

1. **`dev`** - no extra protection. Set any DEV-specific variables here
   (e.g. `ACA_APP_NAME`, `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` pointing at the dev RG).
2. **`qa`** - usually no required reviewers, but isolated variables for
   the QA environment.
3. **`production`** - set:
   - **Required reviewers**: at least one (deploys to PROD will pause
     here until approved).
   - (Optional) **Wait timer** for an extra delay.
   - (Optional) **Deployment branches**: restrict to `main`.
   - PROD-specific variables (e.g. production resource group).

Tell the user that env-specific variables on the `production` environment
will override repo-level ones automatically inside the prod workflow.

### Azure DevOps

In **Pipelines → Environments**, create three: `dev`, `qa`,
`production`. On `production`, add a manual approval check (Approvals
and checks → New check → Approvals).

In **Pipelines → Library**, create a variable group named `agentops`
with these variables (mark sensitive ones as secret if needed):

- `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`
- `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` - optional fallback if the
  Foundry project's App Insights connection cannot be auto-discovered.

In **Project settings → Service connections**, create an Azure Resource
Manager service connection named `agentops-azure` scoped to the
subscription that hosts your Foundry project.

Grant the build service "Contribute to pull requests" permission on the
repository (Project settings → Repositories → Security → `Build Service`)
so the PR-comment step can post.

## Step 3 - Configure Azure auth

### GitHub Actions (OIDC)

At repository level (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
**Variables** tab), set:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` - App registration / managed identity used for OIDC.
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` - Foundry project URL used by the
  eval step.
- `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` - optional fallback as a
  variable or secret. Generated workflows first try to auto-discover App
  Insights from the Foundry project endpoint; this value makes eval and
  Doctor telemetry explicit.

Then configure Workload Identity Federation on the Azure side
(`federated-credentials` on the app registration) for **each branch /
environment** the workflows will run from. See
`docs/ci-github-actions.md` for the exact `az` commands.

Tell the user that CI evals emit `agentops.eval.*` telemetry and scheduled
Doctor runs emit `agentops.agent.finding.*` telemetry when App Insights is
configured or auto-discovered. The Cockpit uses those signals for Azure
Monitor deep links.

### Azure DevOps (Service Connection)

Already done in Step 2 - the `agentops-azure` service connection
handles auth. Make sure the underlying service principal or managed
identity has the **Azure AI User** role on the Foundry account.

## Step 4 - Use azd for deployment

If the repo already has `azure.yaml`, generate azd-backed deployment
workflows:

```bash
agentops workflow generate --kinds pr,dev,qa,prod --deploy-mode azd --force
```

The deploy workflows will:

1. run `azd env new ... || azd env select ...` in CI;
2. run `azd provision --no-prompt` for DEV by default;
3. run `azd provision --no-prompt` for QA/PROD only when manually
   requested (`provision=true` in GitHub Actions or
   `RUN_AZD_PROVISION=true` in Azure DevOps);
4. run `agentops eval run` as the quality/safety gate;
5. run `azd env refresh` on the deploy runner so a fresh CI workspace can
   recover outputs from the previous infrastructure provision;
6. run `azd deploy --no-prompt`.

Set `AZURE_ENV_NAME` per GitHub Environment / Azure DevOps variable
group if the user's azd env names are not exactly `dev`, `qa`, and
`production`. Set `AZURE_LOCATION` when the azd template needs an
explicit region.

### If the user asks for "zero-trust deployment"

Do **not** replicate azd. Do this instead:

1. Inspect the app and ask only for missing critical choices (region,
   target host, private networking yes/no if not obvious).
2. Prefer an existing azd template or AVM-backed template that already
   implements managed identity, RBAC-only data access, private endpoints
   where required, and no secrets in source.
3. Create or adapt `azure.yaml`, `infra/`, and azd-native hooks declared
   in `azure.yaml` (`preprovision`, `postprovision`, `predeploy`,
   `postdeploy`) as needed.
4. Run `azd provision` to validate the infrastructure path.
5. Re-run `agentops workflow generate --deploy-mode azd --force` so CI
   delegates provision/deploy to azd.

Never call ad-hoc hook scripts from the workflow (for example
`./agentops/deploy.sh` or `./.azd/hooks/*`). If custom behavior is
needed, put it behind azd's native hook mechanism in `azure.yaml`.

### Copied accelerators / AI Landing Zone apps

For Azure AI accelerators copied from templates, use AgentOps to make the
landing-zone path actionable:

1. AgentOps owns eval gates, Doctor, reports, Cockpit readiness, and the
   workflow guardrails around deployment.
2. Foundry owns hosted agents, evaluations, traces, monitoring, datasets, and
   operations.
3. azd/Bicep/AILZ owns app and infrastructure deploy when `azure.yaml` or
   `infra/*.bicep` exists.
4. Project-specific steps such as indexing, data seeding, model deployment,
   container build/push, App Config updates, or private-network post-provision
   work stay in azd hooks or existing project tooling.

If `scripts/Invoke-PreflightChecks.ps1` exists, keep it in the deployment path:
AgentOps-generated azd workflows run it with `-Strict` before `azd provision`.
Doctor surfaces the same path as `AI Landing Zone deployment readiness`, with
evidence for preflight, `agentops.yaml`, azd workflow coverage, network
isolation, and the private runner path.

If `agentops workflow analyze` reports network isolation, private endpoints,
jumpbox/Bastion, Azure Firewall, or ACR Tasks, do not assume GitHub-hosted
runners can deploy everything. Plan self-hosted runner, jumpbox handoff, or ACR
Tasks agent-pool execution before enabling DEV/QA/PROD deploy stages.

If `azure.yaml` is missing and the user is not asking to create the
deployment assets yet, check whether this is a Foundry prompt agent. If
`agentops.yaml` has `agent: "name:version"`, prefer prompt-agent mode:

```bash
agentops workflow generate --kinds pr,dev,qa,prod --deploy-mode prompt-agent --force
```

Prompt-agent workflows:

1. read `prompt_file` from `agentops.yaml` or
   `AGENTOPS_AGENT_PROMPT_FILE`;
2. create or reuse a candidate Foundry prompt-agent version from that file;
3. generate `.agentops/deployments/agentops.candidate.yaml`;
4. run `agentops eval run` against the candidate version;
5. record `.agentops/deployments/foundry-agent.json` as a deployment
   artifact only when the gate passes.

This avoids the bad pattern of evaluating one agent version and deploying a
different prompt. The invariant is: **evaluated version == deployed version**.
Foundry remains the system of record for agent versions; AgentOps owns the
repo-side gate and deployment record.

If this is not a Foundry prompt agent and azd is not ready, generate
`--kinds pr` only or use `--deploy-mode placeholder`. Do not ship
DEV/QA/PROD workflows that pretend deployment is wired.

## Step 5 - Branch protection

In Settings → Branches, add a rule for both `develop` and `main`:

- Require a pull request before merging.
- Require status checks to pass: select **`AgentOps PR / Eval (PR gate)`**
  (the job name from `agentops-pr.yml`).
- Optional: require linear history.

This makes the eval gate a hard merge requirement.

## Step 6 - Iterate

Common follow-ups:

- **Tighten thresholds for QA/PROD** - copy `agentops.yaml` to
  `agentops-qa.yaml` / `agentops-prod.yaml` and tighten the
  `thresholds:` block. Point each workflow at its own config via the
  `inputs.config` default.
- **Scheduled runs** - add a `schedule:` entry in `agentops-pr.yml` (or a
  new `agentops-nightly.yml`) to evaluate against `main` nightly.
- **Matrix per scenario** - if the user has multiple AgentOps config files,
  extend the eval job with `strategy.matrix.config:` and reference
  `${{ matrix.config }}`.
- **Regression baseline** - wire the deploy templates to download the
  previous run's `results.json` artifact and call
  `agentops eval run --baseline <results.json>`.

## Guardrails

- Do **not** invent CLI flags. The supported `workflow analyze` flags are
  `--dir`, `--format`, and `--out`. The supported `workflow generate` flags are
  `--force`, `--dir`, `--kinds`, `--platform`, and `--deploy-mode`.
- Do **not** push DEV/QA/PROD deploy workflows with placeholder
  Build/Deploy steps or missing OIDC variables; generate PR-only first.
- Do **not** create parallel workflow files. Prefer editing the
  generated ones.
- Do **not** auto-fill app/infrastructure deployment with raw Azure CLI
  steps that bypass azd. AgentOps gates; azd provisions and deploys. For
  Foundry prompt agents, use `--deploy-mode prompt-agent` so the workflow
  calls the Foundry SDK and evaluates the candidate version before marking
  it deployed.
- The four workflow names (`agentops-pr`, `agentops-deploy-dev`,
  `agentops-deploy-qa`, `agentops-deploy-prod`) are fixed - don't rename
  them or branch-protection wiring will break.
